REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS FROM SHIPS 
 
Vol. 2: The role of LNG in the transition toward low- and zero-carbon shipping 
 
Submitted by the World Bank 
 
SUMMARY 
Executive summary: 
This document presents the World Bank report Vol. 2: The role of LNG 
in the transition toward low- and zero-carbon shipping. The report 
analyses the potential of LNG as a bunker fuel to play either a transitional 
or a temporary role to reduce GHG emissions from ships in line with the 
Paris Agreement’s temperature goals, and finds that LNG is likely to play 
a limited role only. The report also discusses the potential role of LNG as 
a feedstock to kickstart the production of zero-carbon bunker fuels. 
Finally, the report recommends that countries should avoid new public 
policy that supports LNG as a bunker fuel, reconsider existing policy 
support, and continue to regulate methane emissions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
LNG AS A BUNKER FUEL
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as a bunker fuel has the potential to offer important 
reductions in atmospheric pollution—that is, air pollutants and greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions—from ships. Compared to traditional oil-derived bunker fuels such 
as heavy fuel oil (HFO), LNG clearly emits significantly lower quantities of sulfur 
oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). At the same time, 
it also contains up to 30 percent less carbon per unit of chemical energy (calorific 
value). Because of this lower carbon content, the use of LNG results in carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions at combustion that are lower than for traditional oil-derived 
bunker fuels usually burned in ship engines.
This lower carbon content of LNG allows for a theoretical reduction in GHG emissions, 
yet it remains unclear whether there is a true holistic lifecycle GHG benefit of using 
LNG relative to oil-derived bunker fuels. The reason for this is that LNG is effectively 
liquefied methane, and methane is itself a highly potent GHG. Over 20-year and 
100-year time horizons, methane is respectively 86 times and 36 times more potent 
a GHG than CO2 (IPCC 2013). Therefore, any GHG emissions from unburnt methane 
released to the atmosphere—called methane leakage or methane slip—can 
diminish or even entirely offset the theoretical GHG benefit of the use of LNG.
In the current literature, different GHG emissions factors for LNG (depending on 
the varying methane leakage assumptions applied to LNG production pathways 
and its use on board vessels) reflect this uncertainty. This leads to a wide range of 
outcomes in the literature with regard to the GHG benefits from the use of LNG—
or disbenefits, if the emissions of methane are assumed to be high. To test the 
consequences of different scenarios of LNG use, the GHG benefits or disbenefits 
are not presumed either way. Instead, the consequences of a foreseeable range of 
methane leakage, GHG emissions, and machinery efficiencies across the lifecycle 
are analyzed to place bounds on the size of the GHG benefits or disbenefits. These 
are then discussed in the context of the maritime transport sector’s climate targets.
The general uncertainty about LNG’s GHG benefits or disbenefits has created 
tensions within the shipping industry. On the one hand, the use of LNG offers 
immediate and tangible benefits to air quality. On the other, there are controversies 
about the capability of LNG to contribute to GHG reductions in both the short and long 
terms. This report examines those controversies using a combination of literature 
review, critical analysis of this literature, and new analytical work. The report brings 
together findings from all these research methods to assess the overall potential 
and risks of LNG use in shipping. It then uses the findings to identify the likely future 
role of LNG as a bunker fuel, and the implications of that role for both policymakers 
and industry.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 VOLUME 2: THE ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
II
LNG’S CLIMATE CONUNDRUM
The unresolved question of LNG’s lifecycle GHG performance has taken on 
additional importance with the introduction of the Initial International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (known as 
the “Initial IMO GHG Strategy”). The Initial IMO GHG Strategy, adopted in April 2018, 
represents the IMO’s contribution to the global GHG reductions necessary to achieve 
the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals. The Initial IMO GHG Strategy commits the 
industry to achieve a minimum 50 percent reduction in the GHG emissions from the 
international maritime fleet by 2050 relative to a 2008 baseline (IMO 2018b). It also 
includes the ambition to exceed this target, if possible, by calling for GHG emissions 
to be phased out as quickly as possible within this century (IMO 2018b). This report’s 
logic is derived from the assumption that the IMO will, at a minimum, achieve the 
least ambitious interpretation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, that is the 50 percent 
reduction by 2050.
There is a general consensus within the shipping industry that achieving the IMO’s 
climate targets will require significantly limiting the use of fossil fuels, including LNG, 
and rapidly developing and increasingly using zero-carbon bunker fuels (ICS 2018). 
Such zero-carbon bunker fuels are expected to emit very low, and ultimately zero, 
GHG emissions across their full lifecycle, that is production, distribution, and use. 
If the IMO was to exceed its 2050 climate target, this would effectively rule out 
all but a small share (for example, 10 percent) of fossil fuel use by mid-century. 
Consequently, the IMO’s climate targets lead to the question whether the shipping 
industry, as a whole, would be well-advised to further invest in the vessels and 
supply infrastructure necessary to use LNG at large scale. For the purposes of this 
report, a large-scale (or significant) uptake of LNG has been defined as greater than 
10 percent of the fuel mix in energy terms.
Any major investments in LNG capacity would imply that over the three decades 
from 2020–2050 the shipping industry would be required to undergo not just one 
but two major energy transitions: first from oil-derived bunker fuels to LNG, and then 
from LNG to zero-carbon bunker fuels. This raises the following question: What role 
is LNG as a bunker fuel likely to play in the years 2020–2050? Or more specifically, 
will LNG play a “transitional,” a “temporary,” or a “limited” role in the sector’s transition 
toward low- and zero-carbon shipping? This report seeks to answer this question 
from the perspective of the shipping industry as a whole, rather than focusing on a 
particular niche or company.
CURRENT DISCUSSIONS ON LNG’S FUTURE ROLE
Several studies reviewed in the process of compiling this report have examined the 
potential future role of LNG as a bunker fuel. The literature review highlights the 
heterogeneity of findings regarding the expected uptake of LNG, both in the short 
term (up to 2030) and the long term (out to 2050).
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
III
There is a lack of consensus in the reviewed literature on the possible role of LNG 
in the decarbonization of international shipping. Currently, studies can “cherry-pick” 
from a range of assumptions regarding GHG emissions factors, macroeconomic 
considerations, technology pathways, and regulatory measures. This selective 
process can then be used to create seemingly credible narratives for a wide range 
of LNG uptake outcomes. In reviewing and understanding the assumptions used, 
this report takes a first step to move beyond the current situation.
The report does not find any clear, strong, and unambiguous short-term drivers 
which currently point toward LNG's large-scale uptake as a bunker fuel for 
propulsion purposes. In the short term, the literature suggests, for instance, that 
the macroeconomic drivers for the uptake of LNG seem uncertain. There may be a 
present-day price spread between crude oil and natural gas pricing which favors 
LNG over oil-derived bunker fuels. However, this price spread may or may not 
remain favorable over the course of this decade or beyond.
Large-scale adoption therefore appears to be at the mercy of the various regulatory 
mechanisms of the shipping industry. While a review of these regulations identifies 
some potential drivers for LNG adoption, such as the IMO Sulfur Cap 2020, Emission 
Control Areas, and the Energy Efficiency Design Index, it also finds that the incentives 
these policies provide do not appear sufficiently strong to justify expectations of a 
significant uptake of LNG in the short term.
By far the largest potential policy impact on bunker fuel selection is likely to come 
from the Initial IMO GHG Strategy and the subsequent detailed policy measures 
that are to be implemented to achieve the IMO’s climate targets. Following the 
general consensus in the shipping industry, this report agrees that the Initial IMO 
GHG Strategy and the IMO’s climate targets are not consistent with the large-scale 
use of LNG in the long term (ICS 2018, IMO 2018a, GMF 2018). Moreover, this report 
assumes that the Initial IMO GHG Strategy is also unlikely to be compatible with a 
significant uptake of LNG in the short term and therefore tests this assumption by 
analyzing the possibilities of LNG to serve as a “transitional” or “temporary” bunker 
fuel to meet the IMO’s 2050 climate target.
LNG AS A “TRANSITIONAL” BUNKER FUEL?
To avoid the need for a double investment in zero-carbon fuel supply infrastructure 
for shipping, proponents of LNG as a transitional fuel often suggest that the 
infrastructure put in place for LNG could later be reused in a zero-carbon future (“use 
and reuse”). For example, it could serve compatible drop-in zero-carbon bunker 
fuels, such as liquefied biomethane (LBM) and green liquefied synthetic methane 
(LSM). However, this proposition is being increasingly challenged.
While the GHG intensity of LBM and LSM could be consistent with the GHG reduction 
target set by the Initial IMO GHG Strategy for 2050, there are serious concerns 
about the availability of sustainably sourced and cost-competitive LBM in a global 
 VOLUME 2: THE ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
IV
market where several sectors (for instance, aviation) are likely to compete for the 
same feedstocks and fuels. Furthermore, the production of LSM appears to remain 
relatively expensive compared to other zero-carbon bunker fuel alternatives such 
as ammonia or hydrogen. A parallel review of a large volume of existing literature 
on alternative zero-carbon bunker fuel options has led to a shortlist of the candidate 
bunker fuels most likely to dominate the 2040s and 2050s (Volume 1: The Potential 
of Zero-Carbon Bunker Fuels in Developing Countries, see Preamble). Both LBM 
and LSM variants of natural gas were considered, but consistent with other studies 
were not found to be economically competitive in the long term.
Overall, the two zero-carbon bunker fuels with the best prospects were found to 
be ammonia and hydrogen. However, those zero-carbon bunker fuels would 
require technical infrastructure and onboard technologies that are not aligned with 
investments in LNG technology and LNG supply infrastructure for shipping. The 
technical incompatibility of the lower-cost ammonia and hydrogen bunker fuels 
with LNG assets means that there are significant risks that speak against LNG as a 
transitional fuel.
LNG AS A “TEMPORARY” BUNKER FUEL?
The existence of significant downside environmental and financial risks, in 
combination with uncertain upside potential, suggests that it also is unlikely that 
LNG will play a temporary role in the decarbonization of shipping. In this report, 
a temporary role refers to a situation where—contrary to a transitional role—
investments in LNG-supply infrastructure and LNG-fueled ships are not taken 
advantage of at a second stage where zero-carbon bunker fuels enter the global 
fleet (“use and stop”). This report provides an analysis and an accompanying 
reasoning that supports the claim that LNG is not likely to play a temporary role. 
In particular, it estimates—under idealized conditions—only a moderate, but still 
uncertain GHG reduction benefit at best. Additionally, it forecasts the need for 
significant additional capital expenditures to achieve a two-stage conversion (oil to 
LNG, followed by LNG to zero-carbon) as opposed to a single-stage conversion (oil 
to zero-carbon only), with the latter implying a limited role for LNG.
This report’s analysis is not intended as a projection of what will happen. It is 
designed instead to demonstrate the GHG impact that LNG could have when used 
as a temporary bunker fuel, and to estimate the related cost against a counterfactual 
scenario in which LNG plays a limited role. This counterfactual scenario is provided 
by the report Aggregate investment for the decarbonization of the shipping industry 
(UMAS 2020)—see Box 1 for further details. As such, the report examines the impacts 
of an idealized uptake case for LNG in a world where a very strong commercial 
driver or regulatory mechanism could effectively mandate its large-scale use. All 
scenarios used assume that the IMO’s 2050 climate target is met.
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
V
BOX 1:  
NON-LNG 
DECARBONIZATION 
COUNTERFACTUAL 
CASE
In the referenced counterfactual decarbonization trajectory (UMAS 2020), it is 
assumed that additional policy (for example, a carbon price) will be introduced 
to incentivize an energy transition of the magnitude that is sufficient to make 
zero-carbon bunker fuels more competitive relative to fossil fuels. The 
referenced modelled case evaluates the profit-maximizing solution based on 
that policy incentive. In such a case, if operators choose to continue using 
LNG, then on average they will be doing so uncompetitively and with greater 
total cost of ownership than competitors who operate zero-carbon newbuilds 
or retrofits.
Comparing the cases assuming LNG’s role as a temporary bunker fuel to the 
counterfactual case, it is estimated that such a two-stage conversion would create 
a need for additional investments of up to $186 billion during the 2020s (both in the 
international maritime fleet and on land). It should be noted that these are additional 
capital expenditures of at least 10-17 percent as shown by Table 1. When these 
capital flows are discounted to their present value in 2020, using a discount rate 
of 10 percent, the estimate of the additional capital expenditures associated with a 
“temporary” use of LNG becomes $98 billion and $82 billion for decarbonization 
by 2050 and 2070, respectively. As proportions of the discounted total additional 
capital expenditures for achieving decarbonization, these discounted values 
then both represent over 30 percent of additional capital expenditures required 
to achieve full decarbonization. This also indicates the scale of additional capital 
expenditures investment only, but is not an estimate of the value returned on that 
investment. Due to the practical limitation imposed by the rate of vessel newbuilds, 
these investments would lead LNG to capture at most approximately 40 percent in 
energy terms of the bunker fuel market by 2030.

Depending on the methane leakage assumptions used, this market penetration in 
2030 would result in either a peak GHG benefit of eight percent, or a peak disbenefit 
of nine percent. This would be the case even in an idealized world, with more than 
significant LNG market uptake and optimistic assumptions regarding LNG’s potential

VI
for GHG emissions reduction. In any case, the estimated GHG benefits would not 
be transformative. On the contrary, under less favorable assumptions a significant 
deployment of LNG would result in even higher GHG emissions than the baseline. 
That is to say, it remains unclear whether GHG emissions would actually be higher 
or lower if the industry continued using heavy fuel oil before zero-carbon bunker 
fuels are scaled up from 2030.
The investment required in these LNG cases would be in addition to the total 
investments needed to decarbonize shipping in the counterfactual case ($1.0-$1.9 
trillion). It would furthermore be required in parts of the industry (that is, fleet and land-
side technologies) where the additional LNG investments could not be leveraged 
or reused for zero-carbon bunker fuels. The temporary use of LNG is, thus, likely 
to lead to GHG outcomes which may range from moderate GHG benefits to GHG 
disbenefits—in addition to considerable additional capital expenditures relative to a 
counterfactual scenario with a rather limited role for LNG.
The analysis also considers the utilization rates of the relatively short-lived LNG 
assets: if capital of up to $186 billion could be raised, it could likely face significant 
risks to its return. Of course, capital may be paid off before these risks materialize 
and before the economic life of the specific LNG asset ends. In this instance, the 
asset owner may, however, still face residual value or risk other forms of write-down 
in asset value.
When LNG is expected to play a temporary role in shipping, the demand for LNG (and 
by association LNG-fueled ships) peaks around the early 2030s and then declines 
rapidly in a timeframe shorter than the economic life of these assets. One possible 
consequence of these financial risks could be increased commercial and political 
pressure to ensure a more gradual phase-out of LNG use and more gradual decline 
in demand for LNG as a bunker fuel. However, this in turn would create a substantial 
environmental risk: such technology lock-in could result in large increases in GHG 
emissions above the declining levels currently required to meet the IMO’s 2050 
climate target.
This report’s modelling therefore reinforces the conclusions from the literature 
review. The literature review highlights the current lack of a clear, strong, and 
unambiguous driver for the large-scale uptake of LNG. The analysis based on 
modelling further concludes that even if a very strong commercial or regulatory 
driver were present within the shipping industry, the GHG performance and additional 
capital expenditures of LNG would likely be such as to make significant deployment 
unattractive from an environmental perspective and with a strong potential to be 
inefficient from an economic perspective.
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
VII
A “LIMITED” ROLE FOR LNG AS A BUNKER FUEL
Overall, this report suggests that, even in the short term, LNG may only play a limited 
role in the decarbonization of the maritime transport sector. A significant transitional 
role for LNG is mainly jeopardized, amongst other factors, by the questionable 
supply of sustainably sourced and cost-competitive LBM and LSM. A large-scale 
temporary role for LNG appears unlikely due to the uncertain GHG benefits, the 
additional capital expenditures, the risk of stranded assets, and most importantly 
the risk of a technology lock-in with a GHG emissions trajectory which would be 
incompatible with the IMO’s 2050 climate target.
Nevertheless, it is possible that some jurisdictions may have a domestic interest to 
make significant short-term investments in LNG, for instance, to reap the obvious 
air quality benefits. In such specific cases, the supply and use of LNG could be 
guaranteed and monitored to show control of unintended methane emissions 
which would ensure a meaningful GHG benefit relative to conventional oil-derived 
fuels. Yet there are reasons to believe that these situations may not necessarily 
materialize because, depending on the technology used on board, the same air 
pollution benefits can be achieved by zero-carbon bunker fuels, too. There are 
advantages to addressing both air pollutants and GHG emissions by means of a 
single solution. This single solution appears particularly relevant as the timescale 
required for rapidly deploying zero-carbon bunker fuels, that is from 2030 to 
achieve even the least ambitious interpretation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, is 
short. In any case, at present, these special cases where short-term investments in 
LNG could be warranted are not expected to create a significant increase in global 
demand for LNG as a bunker fuel for propulsion purposes.
Consequently, there can be niche circumstances, which are outside of this report’s 
wider perspective, and which may allow for decisions contrary to the general 
conclusions. Specific circumstances may speak in favor of niche applications for 
LNG and against alternative options. These specific circumstances can deviate 
significantly from the whole-sector assumptions applied in this report and would be 
related to short-term advantages. Such examples may exist on privileged routes 
that already benefit from existing LNG terminals at either port, for specific vessel 
types such as LNG carriers, ferries, cruise ships or coastal vessels, or in special 
circumstances when there are strong domestic interests as described above.
IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYMAKERS
As outlined by the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, the shipping industry has firmly 
committed to reduce and eliminate GHG emissions from ships in line with achieving 
the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals. In light of this Paris-aligned GHG emissions 
reduction trajectory, the uncertainties surrounding the GHG benefits of LNG suggest 
that new public policy support for LNG as a bunker fuel should be avoided. This 
 VOLUME 2: THE ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
VIII
relates, for example, to policy that provides a regulatory advantage to LNG over 
oil-derived alternatives in shipping. Furthermore, the same reasoning also suggests 
that existing policy support for LNG as a bunker fuel should be curtailed. In this 
regard, the sector’s current Energy Efficiency Design Index, for instance, exclusively 
focuses on downstream CO2 emissions (that is, due to combustion on board), thereby 
disregarding any upstream or midstream CO2 emissions (that is, due to extraction 
and distribution, respectively) or any non-CO2 GHG emissions such as methane.
The report highlights the need for urgent and strong policy action to regulate 
methane emissions both in the supply chain of LNG and in its use on board existing 
ships and any newbuilds. This will be important regardless of whether LNG becomes 
a significant bunker fuel or not. For example, although downstream methane 
emissions could be reduced using newer machinery with lower methane slip levels, 
this would still not address the risk of upstream and midstream methane emissions 
in the supply chain. These present a much more complex problem that is not strictly 
technological in nature, but would require regulatory changes and enforcement 
across the numerous jurisdictions where LNG is extracted and distributed. Many of 
these jurisdictions suffer from generally low regulatory enforcement levels (World 
Justice Project 2020). However, the increasing public scrutiny questioning the 
true lifecycle GHG emissions of any fuel used in a decarbonizing world is likely to 
incentivize such enhanced regulation, too.
Regulating methane is also important to ensure that shipping’s existing LNG assets 
and any that may be built because of commerciaI-case justification in the short 
term are effectively shielded from the risk of increased lifecycle GHG emissions 
relative to conventional oil-derived bunker fuels, and are enabled to maximize their 
potential social benefits (for air quality in particular). The need for stringent policy 
to avoid this risk becomes even more important if the actual energy transition in 
shipping from fossil bunker fuels to zero-carbon bunker fuels were to happen more 
slowly than anticipated in this report.
The report also presents a strong recommendation to focus public support on the 
development of policy that effectively accelerates the research, development, and 
deployment of zero-carbon bunker fuels. Such policies would send another clear 
signal with respect to LNG’s future role, and help mitigate the risks associated with 
a significant future uptake of LNG.
Finally, the parallel analysis of zero-carbon bunker fuels finds that the most 
promising candidate options will require zero-carbon hydrogen as a feedstock 
(Volume 1, see Preamble). There are two major production pathways for producing 
such hydrogen: the first one uses electrolysis powered by 100 percent non-biogenic 
renewable electricity to produce “green” hydrogen; the second involves using 
natural gas in conjunction with nearly 100 percent carbon capture and storage to 
produce “blue" hydrogen. Therefore, in contrast to LNG’s direct use as a bunker fuel 
for propulsion purposes, it is quite possible that natural gas could play an important 
role in shipping’s decarbonization as a feedstock for the production of zero-carbon 
bunker fuels such as blue hydrogen, as illustrated in Figure 1. More information on 
zero-carbon bunker fuels in general, and blue hydrogen specifically, can be found 
in the related Volume 1 (see Preamble).

Policies to support zero-carbon bunker fuels as mentioned above are advantageous 
because these are long-term solutions that can solve both the GHG and air pollution 
reduction challenges faced by shipping. As always, any policy that can provide 
regulatory clarity and consistency will help industry to make more certain long-term 
decisions about shipping’s decarbonization.
IMPLICATIONS FOR INDUSTRY
Shipping’s decarbonization is not driven by public policy alone. It is also driven by 
owners, fuel suppliers, financiers, and shareholders managing their own exposure 
to climate-related investment risks, and by clients and consumers looking to 
decarbonize their wider scopes of emissions. Making overt decisions contrary to 
the logical pathway for shipping’s decarbonization can therefore pose risks both 
to compliance with more and more stringent policies implemented in line with the

X
Paris Agreement’s temperature goals, but also in terms of future access to financial 
capital and market share.
The analysis in this report concludes that LNG is likely to have a limited role as 
a bunker fuel, with any demand for LNG rapidly declining after 2030. Therefore, 
to minimize the potential loss of returns, industry stakeholders should consider 
LNG's questionable long-term competitiveness as a bunker fuel when developing 
their future business strategies. Furthermore, in light of a world with more and more 
commitments by public and private players to net zero GHG emissions by mid-
century, industry stakeholders should also take into consideration the evolving 
climate policy landscape and the rising societal pressure in and outside the shipping 
sector when counting on a significant uptake of LNG as a bunker fuel. Niche-market 
investments in LNG are likely to face increasing headwinds through the course of 
the 2020s in such a context.
The current uncertainty within the industry, which does not know for certain yet 
which specific future zero-carbon bunker fuels to invest in, is understandable. 
The resulting hesitance in terms of investment decisions is reflected in the current 
orderbooks for new vessels, where global orders have recently been at the lowest 
level observed since 1989 (Clarksons Research 2020). While major businesses 
are already announcing their favored zero-carbon shipping solutions all industry 
— especially the ones with a lower risk appetite—are well advised to opt for the 
following: investing in increased energy efficiency and remaining flexible on 
other investments’ compatibility with multiple zero-carbon candidate bunker fuels. 
Investments in increased energy efficiency represent “no-regret” investments which 
will benefit any kind of future bunker fuels. Flexibility in ship design will allow 
using oil-derived bunker fuels up to the moment when the fuel supply can be more 
confidently switched to zero-carbon bunker fuels. This flexibility can be achieved, 
for instance, through installing fuel storage and fuel handling equipment that will be 
compatible with a maximum number of emerging zero-carbon bunker fuels—most 
likely ammonia and hydrogen (Volume 1, see Preamble).
Just as for policymakers, all these current decisions faced by industry will be easier 
to resolve when there is greater certainty on the availability, prices, and timing of 
non-oil-derived bunker fuels. Working toward increased clarity through constructive 
support of the policy development processes, and through multi-stakeholder 
collaborations, remains vital.

1.	 INTRODUCTION
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is viewed by many stakeholders in the maritime transport 
sector as a potential alternative to conventional oil-derived bunker fuels such as 
the predominant heavy fuel oil (HFO). Increasing attention has been directed to its 
deployment in recent years, partly as a consequence of the International Maritime 
Organization’s (IMO) 0.5 percent sulfur emission capping regulation, called “IMO 
Sulfur Cap 2020”, which came into force in 2020 (IMO 2016). The use of LNG rather 
than HFO can result in significant reductions of sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions of up 
to 100 percent, and reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and in particulate 
matter (PM) of up to 90 percent (Kristensen 2010). These emissions are collectively 
referred to as “air pollutant” emissions and are associated with a multitude of negative 
environmental and health impacts. The impacts include increased premature death 
rates or reduced crop yields. Shipping emits around 15 percent and 13 percent of all 
SOx and NOx, respectively (IMO 2014). These emissions, combined with a number of 
other air pollutants such as PM, led shipping to be held responsible for 15 percent 
of global premature deaths from air pollution— or 60,000 in absolute numbers— in 
2015 (ICCT 2019).
Due to lower SOx, NOx, and PM emissions, decades-long debates about air 
pollution and sulfur regulation have promoted the consideration of LNG as a 
beneficial alternative to HFO. In 2005, these debates and other environmental 
concerns resulted in the passage of Annex VI of the International Convention for 
the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) which limits, amongst others, SOx 
and NOx emissions from ship exhaust and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone-
depleting substances. The Annex also sets designated Emission Control Areas and 
more stringent standards for SOx, NOx, and PM. Partly as a consequence of this, 
the sector has built significant experience in handling and using LNG as a cost-
effective bunker fuel. LNG, including when it is carried as a cargo and the boil-off 
from that cargo is combusted, currently represents approximately 3.3 percent of 
overall energy use in shipping (IMO 2020).

 2
INTRODUCTION
More recently, the debate has culminated in the IMO Sulfur Cap 2020 regulation 
mentioned above. The 15-year drive for lower air pollutant emissions has created 
an opportunity for fossil bunker fuels which are cleaner than the incumbent HFO. 
Current alternatives include LNG, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), low sulfur heavy 
fuel oil (LSHFO), and marine diesel oil (MDO), each with different advantages and 
disadvantages, different implications for the specification, cost and operation of 
machinery onboard, and different price points and availabilities. For example, it still 
remains difficult to abate PM emissions from LSHFO or MDO, even if the currently 
available emissions reduction technologies are fully applied (Lehtoranta et al., 2019).
LNG, as the name suggests, is a liquefied form of natural gas. Fossil natural gas 
is extracted from geological features and liquefied to increase its volumetric 
energy density. This increased density allows LNG to be transported 
economically on board LNG tanker vessels and distributed around the globe. 
LNG is a globally traded commodity used across a vast range of energy-
intensive sectors.
LNG is a cryogenic liquid stored at approximately -162 degrees Celsius. It 
therefore requires heavily insulated tanks for storage, and, in some instances, 
active cooling or re-liquefaction plants. Even in its liquid state, LNG is less 
energy-dense than oil-derived bunker fuels when assessed on a volume 
basis.
A further benefit of LNG compared to traditional oil-derived bunker fuels is its 
relative carbon efficiency. LNG contains up to 30 percent less carbon per unit 
of chemical energy (calorific value) than the various oil-derived fuels. This gives 
LNG a theoretical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions benefit relative to traditional 
oil-derived bunker fuels. In the maritime transport sector, the GHG performance of 
bunker fuels has gained more attention due to the IMO’s Energy Efficiency Design 
Index (EEDI) regulation, which mandates energy efficiency measures aimed at 
reducing GHG emissions from ships.3 In combination with the significant air pollution 
benefits, and the framing of EEDI on operational carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
only, the theoretical GHG benefit of LNG has resulted in further renewed interest in 
LNG as a bunker fuel.
However, whether the theoretical GHG benefit of LNG can be fully realized in 
practice remains controversial. LNG is effectively liquefied methane, and methane 
itself is a GHG which is 86 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year period and 36 
times over a 100-year time horizon (IPCC 2013). Any emissions of unburnt methane 
that evaporate into the atmosphere could therefore offset the theoretical climate 
benefit of burning LNG and could in some cases cause higher total GHG emissions 
than the use of traditional oil-derived bunker fuels.
The evasion of unburnt methane to the atmosphere—known as “methane leakage 
or methane slip” —can occur at any point in the fuel’s lifecycle, including extraction, 
processing, transportation, refueling, and combustion in the vessel’s internal

combustion engine. Estimates of methane leakage range widely, with some papers 
finding an overall 21 percent reduction in GHG emissions (Thinkstep 2019) while 
others show, in some scenarios, a slight increase on a 100-year Global Warming 
Potential (GWP) basis (ICCT 2020), always relative to oil-derived fuels.4
This uncertainty over the size and direction of the effect of LNG use on GHG 
emissions has created considerable tension within the maritime industry. On the 
one hand, the use of LNG clearly results in immediate benefits to air quality and 
sulfur compliance. On the other, there is concern over the capacity of LNG to reduce 
net GHG emissions both in the short term and the longer term.
This concern has gained salience following the announcement of the Initial IMO 
GHG Strategy, which represents the IMO’s pledged contribution to the global GHG 
reductions required to achieve the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals (UNFCCC 
2016). As shown by Figure 2, the Initial IMO GHG Strategy commits to a minimum 50 
percent reduction in GHG emissions from the international maritime fleet by 2050 
relative to a 2008 baseline, with the stated ambition of exceeding this reduction, if 
possible (IMO 2018b). The Initial IMO GHG Strategy also calls for the phasing out of 
GHG emissions entirely as quickly as possible within this century (IMO 2018b).
These targets, in combination with further expected growth in maritime trade and 
transport, mean that the large-scale use of LNG, a fossil fuel, for ship-propulsion

In the Thinkstep reference, the 21 percent benefit is achieved for a 2-stroke internal combustion engine with HFO 
as a reference fuel. A lower benefit is achieved for a 4-stroke internal combustion engine referencing HFO fuel 
(15 percent), and the GHG benefit is further lowered when comparing against MDO fuel. Detailed discussions of 
different assumptions in different reports is given in section 2.2.1.

INTRODUCTION
purposes risks being neither consistent nor compatible with the Initial IMO GHG 
Strategy, and that any use of LNG in the short term must be phased out in the longer 
term if the IMO’s climate targets are to be achieved. Achieving IMO’s climate targets 
will require zero-carbon bunker fuels, at least in the long term, estimated in this 
report to be from 2030 onwards (see Appendix A).
This report discusses the use of “zero-carbon” bunker fuels as an essential 
step in achieving the climate targets of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy. In the 
context of this report, the general term “zero-carbon” refers to bunker fuels 
that emit very low, and ultimately zero, GHG emissions (including CO2 and 
methane) across their full lifecycle, that is production, distribution, and use. 
Zero-carbon bunker fuels can be either “effectively” zero or “net-zero” carbon 
fuels.
An “effectively” zero-carbon bunker fuel is produced using zero-carbon 
electricity (for example, electricity produced from renewable energy or 
from natural gas combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS)), thereby 
avoiding GHG emissions altogether. Within this context, hydrogen (H2) and 
ammonia (NH3), for instance, can represent such zero-carbon bunker fuels. If 
produced with zero-carbon electricity or natural gas with CCS, they emit no 
CO2 across their full lifecycle, including their use in the propulsion machinery 
on board the ship.
A “net-zero” bunker fuel is one where its production removes a quantity of CO2 
from the atmosphere which is equivalent to that emitted during combustion. 
For example, both liquefied biomethane (LBM) and green liquefied synthetic 
methane (LSM) can represent net-zero carbon bunker fuels. They do emit 
CO2 during their use in the propulsion machinery on board the ship. However, 
since they also retrieve CO2 from the atmosphere during their production (for 
instance, the growth of biogenic feedstock for LBM or the direct air capture of 
CO2 from the atmosphere for LSM), they can be labelled as net zero-carbon 
bunker fuels.
Both categories may emit small amounts of GHG emissions in their respective 
upstream processes (for example, land use, harvesting, refining, transport, or 
processing to capture and store CO2). As such, the term “zero” is used to label 
fuels that have a small enough overall GHG impact that they are capable of 
delivering the IMO’s minimum target of a 50 percent absolute reduction by 
2050 even when considering these lifecycle GHG emissions, and that with 
strict management of upstream (mostly land-side) GHG emissions can achieve 
a complete 100 percent GHG reduction. This consideration of upstream 
GHG emissions is particularly relevant when natural gas may be used as a 
feedstock for some zero-carbon bunker fuels initially, and emphasizes the 
importance of applying a full lifecycle GHG perspective to both fossil and 
zero-carbon bunker fuels.
More information on zero-carbon bunker fuels can be found in the related 
Volume 1: The Potential of Zero-Carbon bunker Fuels in Developing Countries 
(see Preamble).

While relying exclusively on LNG as a significant bunker fuel will not be consistent 
with the IMO’s climate targets due to LNG’s limited GHG reduction potential, there 
is an important debate about what short-term role (up to 2030), if any, LNG could 
play in driving maritime transport sector’s decarbonization. Various factors are 
considered in this debate, including the uncertain GHG effects and the certain air 
quality and sulfur compliance benefits of LNG use.
Broadly speaking, maritime industry stakeholders take three basic positions today. 
This report builds on these positions to carry out a scenario analysis, and thus refers 
to them as potential “Futures”:
1.	 Future 1: A transitional role for LNG – “Use and reuse”: Some stakeholders 
see a transitional role for LNG where investment in supply infrastructure and 
LNG-fueled ships is paid off by reusing these assets with compatible zero-carbon 
bunker fuels. For instance, this compatibility with specific zero-carbon bunker 
fuels would allow for the reuse of the same transport, refueling, and vessel 
investments originally deployed for fossil-derived LNG. While LBM or green 
LSM are straightforwardly LNG-compatible (with no or very minor modifications 
to current LNG specifications), zero-carbon bunker fuels such as hydrogen or 
ammonia would not be compatible. In this Future 1, the IMO’s climate targets are 
achieved through energy efficiency measures and a shift to LNG-compatible 
zero-carbon bunker fuels. Alternatively, they could be achieved by retrofitting, 
at an acceptable cost, supply infrastructure and LNG-fueled ships to use other 
zero-carbon bunker fuels (DNV GL 2019).
2.	 Future 2: A temporary role for LNG – “Use and then stop”: Other stakeholders 
foresee a temporary role for LNG. In this scenario, fossil-derived LNG could 
help reduce air pollutant emissions and make some contribution toward GHG 
emission reductions in the immediate future before zero-carbon bunker fuels 
become widely available. LNG would be rapidly superseded when those 
zero-carbon energy sources become available at scale, especially after 2030 
(Baresic et al. 2018; ICCT 2020; Lloyd’s Register and UMAS 2019).
3.	 Future 3: A limited role for LNG – “Limited use overall”: Finally, a third group 
of stakeholders recommends against using LNG as a bunker fuel for shipping 
except in niche applications where it is already in use or in circumstances 
where there is a particularly strong justification. Often studies making this 
recommendation avoid using LNG as a bunker fuel directly for propulsion 
purposes. However, they do consider using natural gas as an energy source 
(in combination with CCS) to produce zero-carbon bunker fuels, for example 
hydrogen and ammonia (Lloyd’s Register and UMAS 2019; Imhof 2019).
Each of these futures requires investments in different land-based infrastructure 
and vessels, leading to different potential risks for investors. For instance, any 
investment in short-term LNG infrastructure would be at risk of being superseded by 
non-compatible zero-carbon alternatives before the assets reach the end of their 
economic lives and payback periods. Understanding these potential futures and the 
factors that influence them, therefore, appears critical to avoiding negative financial 
and environmental consequences.

INTRODUCTION
This report seeks to clarify LNG’s potential role as a bunker fuel in efforts to achieve 
the climate targets set by the Initial IMO GHG Strategy.
	

In section 2, the report first provides an updated literature review, including a 
summary of the main differences between the studies. The section finds that 
environmental, macroeconomic, technological, and regulatory factors currently 
provide rather weak incentives for a significant uptake of LNG in the short term. 
	

In section 3, the report suggests further that the future supply of LNG-compatible 
zero-carbon bunker fuels is not expected to be able to satisfy the overall 
demand for energy from the shipping sector. Together with the weak incentives 
for significant uptake of LNG, these quantity and price challenges make it 
unlikely that LNG will play a transitional role in the decarbonization of shipping 
(Future 1: “Transitional role for LNG”).
	

In section 4, this report employs a holistic model of the international maritime 
fleet to quantify the economic and environmental consequences of using LNG 
as a temporary fuel in the short term (Future 2: “Temporary role for LNG”), before 
shifting to a non-compatible alternative zero-carbon energy source such as 
hydrogen or ammonia at some point. This analysis finds that the temporary 
use of LNG may have an uncertain effect on GHG emissions, ranging from a 
moderate decrease to a moderate increase. In addition, a large-scale uptake of 
LNG would likely require substantial additional capital expenditures, and may 
result in severe financial risks associated with investments in LNG. Overall, this 
analysis suggests that the use of LNG as a temporary fuel may not be likely, 
either.

decarbonization, including a summary of the remaining unknowns.

2.	 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A 
BUNKER FUEL 
Several studies have analyzed the potential of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a 
bunker fuel using different approaches and modelling assumptions. Sub-section 2.1 
highlights the differences in projections for the uptake of LNG in shipping across the 
literature. To show where the sources of uncertainty lie, sub-section 2.2 looks at the 
differences in assumptions across greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts, macroeconomic 
considerations, technological requirements, and regulatory measures. 
For the purposes of this report, a significant uptake of LNG or LNG as a large-scale 
bunker fuel are both used synonymously and have been defined as greater than 10 
percent of the fuel mix in energy terms.
2.1	 LNG UPTAKE PROJECTIONS
This section reviews the state-of-the-art literature on LNG uptake projections. The 
majority of the uptake projection studies that were reviewed estimate an increase 
in the use of LNG on board vessels in the coming decades. However, under a 
decarbonization scenario compliant with the IMO Initial GHG Strategy, the studies 
also conclude that there will be a shift to one or more zero-carbon energy sources 
before 2050. The studies reviewed either assume a “transitional” role, where fossil 
fuel-derived LNG is substituted with either liquefied biomethane (LBM) or liquefied 
synthetic methane (LSM), or a “temporary” role for LNG, with a future shift toward 
zero-carbon alternatives such as ammonia or hydrogen, or some combination of both.
 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL 
8
2.1.1	
Performance of LNG projections relative to historical 
evidence
The real number of LNG-fueled vessels in operation and on order varies drastically 
from the early LNG-fueled vessel predictions. In 2015, 63 LNG-fueled ships were in 
operation, with a further 76 LNG-fueled ships on order (DNV GL 2015). This increased 
moderately to 175 LNG-fueled ships in operation and 232 LNG-fueled ships on order 
by 2020 only, despite the IMO 2020 Sulfur Cap regulation and a decade of falling 
natural gas prices.5 
The actual uptake of LNG-fueled vessels is extremely modest compared to early 
predictions forecasting rapid LNG-fueled vessel growth. For example, DNV GL in 
2012 predicted that there would be over 1,000 LNG fueled vessels by 2020 (DNV 
2012). This forecast was later revised down to between 400-600 LNG-fueled 
vessels in operation by 2020 due to low oil prices and the slower-than-expected 
development of bunkering infrastructure cited as key reasons (Oxford Institute for 
Energy Studies 2018). Furthermore, Lloyd’s Register (2012) forecasted that between 
100-500 LNG-fueled vessels would be in operation by 2020 under their base case 
scenario and high case scenario. This divergence on LNG-fueled ships’ expected 
growth compared to reality demonstrates that predictions estimating LNG’s future 
role as a bunker fuel are often overestimated.
2.1.2	 Short-term projections (up to 2030)
Looking at the current LNG-fueled maritime fleet and the current order book 
to predict the evolution of the fleet appears to be the best way to compare the 
short-term model projections proposed in the literature with actual data from the 
commercial markets.
The order book shows ships which will be launched and enter into service within 
approximately three years. In practice, unreported orders, modifications, and 
cancellations can result in the order book differing from actual outcomes. Still, 
reference to the order book provides a reasonable means of estimating the fleet 
composition in the very near term, and therefore a credible basis for projections to 
2025.
Maritime Strategies International (MSI 2019) provides a benchmark for short-term 
model projections, as it predicts the evolution of a LNG-fueled maritime fleet up 
to 2025 by considering the current LNG-fueled fleet and order book. The analysis 
does not include LNG carriers which often use the boil-off from cargo as an energy 
source, because these do not constitute sales of LNG as a bunker fuel and are 
not indicative of the fuel’s potential in the wider fleet. According to this study, LNG-
fueled vessels account for ten percent of the order book for vessels over 10,000

2020 figures were taken from SEA-LNG Bunker Navigator on 31 December 2020. Available at: https://sea-lng.
org/why-lng/global-fleet/. Furthermore, the majority of the LNG-fueled vessels in operation are ferries, offshore 
supply ships, chemical tankers, and gas tankers. However, crude oil tankers, container ships, cruise ships and 
oil/chemical tankers represent more than 60 percent of future orders for LNG-fuel (DNV Alternative Fuel Insight 
2020).

gross tons. An additional 15 percent are “LNG-ready” as they have anticipated 
conversion to being LNG-fueled but will need a technical retrofit to achieve this. 
The projection shows that by 2025, excluding cases where the cargo is consumed 
onboard LNG carriers, sales of LNG as a bunker fuel may attain a total market 
share of two percent in energy terms,6 representing the consumption of some 7 to 9 
million tons of LNG per year. By assuming that all of the “LNG ready” maritime fleet 
is converted to run on LNG prior to 2025, the LNG fuel market would increase to 10 
to 11 million tons per year, representing a 3 percent market share in bunker fuel sales 
on an energy basis in 2025.
Figure 3: Estimated LNG uptake by 2025 and 2030, percent of fuel demand7
Figure 3 compares various LNG uptake projections found in the literature with 
those estimated by MSI in 2019 and 2025.8 Based on these findings, DNV GL (2019) 
appears likely to be overestimating LNG demand in the near term (12 percent in 
2025, compared with about 2 to 3 percent in 2025 from MSI—even when taking 
into account the omission of LNG carriers in the MSI numbers). DNV GL’s projection 
of 21 percent uptake by 2030 is also significantly higher than the projections from 
the other studies reviewed. When considered in combination, DNV (2012) and DNV 
GL (2019) show similar levels of overestimation relative to what has happened, or is 
happening, with regard to the uptake of LNG as a bunker fuel.

2019 and Lloyd’s Register 2012 were originally expressed in shares of demand expressed in million tons per year. 
They have been converted to shares of demand expressed in energy terms by using the following fuel densities: 
55,000 MJ/t for LNG, and 40,490 MJ/t for HFO/LSHFO (it was assumed that the remaining demand in 2019 and 
2025 was covered by HFO and LSHFO). In 2019, LNG share is less than one percent but reported in all the studies. 
Only Baresic et al. (2018), DNV GL (2019), and DNV GL (2020b) provide an estimate of LNG uptake in 2030.

 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL 
10
In mid-2020, DNV GL provided further insight on their 2030 fuel demand projections. 
DNV GL (2020b) used 30 distinct scenarios across a range of decarbonization 
ambitions, shipping demands, and fuel prices. In this report, DNV GL gives a 2030 
estimate for LNG as a percentage of marine energy demand for two scenarios 
(scenarios 11 and 19). These scenarios have different decarbonization pathways, 
fleet growth projections, and fuel price assumptions. However, both scenarios 
exhibit similar 2030 LNG penetration estimates, with 25 percent and 28 percent 
of maritime energy use, respectively. The result is a projected penetration of LNG 
uptake in 2030 that is broadly similar to the DNV GL’s work from 2019. More broadly, 
this general comparison suggests that there is a considerable degree of uncertainty 
in short-term LNG projections (2020 to 2030).
2.1.3	 Long-term projections (up to 2050)
The IMO Third Greenhouse Gas Study (2014) presents two pathways for LNG bunker 
fuel use in 2050. However, neither scenario that these pathways are derived 
from would enable the international shipping sector to comply with the IMO’s 
decarbonization target (2018b). One pathway projects LNG attaining an 8 percent 
market share by 2050; the other projects a 25 percent market share in the same 
year. A particularly pertinent result from this study is the suggestion that efficiency 
improvements would provide a considerably larger reduction in GHG emissions than 
would a greater degree of LNG penetration. The IMO Fourth Greenhouse Gas Study 
(2020) incorporates two scenarios for the penetration of alternative bunker fuels. 
These alternative bunker fuels include LNG, methanol, and ethanol for instance. In 
the lower bound estimate, these fuels have no penetration by 2050. In the upper 
bound estimate, these fuels are found to be used by 20 percent of the fleet by 
2050. However, no distinction is provided on the share of LNG-fueled shipping 
relative to the use of methanol and ethanol within that percentage. For that reason, 
this reference is not used further to understand the potential role of LNG.
In 2018, UMAS published a report that detailed four LNG uptake scenarios for 
shipping within the European Union by 2050, using the holistic shipping industry 
model Global Transport Model (GloTraM) (Baresic et al. 2018). These scenarios 
seek to cover the full range of decarbonization ambition represented by the IMO’s 
commitment to a 50 to 100 percent GHG reduction by 2050, allowing a part of the 
GHG emissions to be offset in other non-shipping sectors. The report considers the 
following scenarios:
	

“High gas”, where low LNG prices are coupled with low penetration by other 
alternative fuels and significant use of carbon offsetting. This scenario projects 
LNG penetration of 61 percent of total fuel demand by 2050.
	

“Transition”, which entails a more limited use of carbon offsetting but with the 
increased use of hydrogen. The LNG penetration in 2050 under this scenario 
is 11 percent.
 VOLUME 2: THE ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
11
	

“Limited gas”, with higher LNG prices and higher biofuel availability. The LNG 
penetration in 2050 under this scenario is 3 percent.
	

“Business as Usual” (BAU), a scenario that did not achieve the decarbonization 
required by the IMO. The LNG penetration in 2050 under this scenario is 25 
percent.
These projection scenarios lead to 2050 LNG penetration rates of 61 percent (“High 
gas”), 11 percent (“Transition”), 3 percent (“Limited gas”), and 25 percent (“BAU”) of 
total fuel demand. While the first three projections all represent decarbonization 
scenarios (albeit in the case of “high gas” this is only achieved through offsetting 
rather than in-sector GHG emission reductions), LNG’s fossil fuel origins make it 
impossible to approach zero GHG emissions. This means that in the “high gas” 
scenario, the dominant source of GHG emissions reduction comes via out-of-sector 
carbon offsetting. When the use of offsetting is more constrained (as in the “transition” 
and “limited gas” scenarios), the uptake of LNG is significantly reduced and zero-
carbon alternative bunker fuels (for example, hydrogen) form a larger share of the 
fuel mix. While noting that the report did not consider the potential use of LBM or 
LSM, the scenarios suggest that LNG may play only a temporary or very limited role 
in the decarbonization of shipping.
The 2018 UMAS study was undertaken before the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, 
which seems to emphasize an absolute GHG reduction from within the maritime 
sector. Many observers have interpreted the Strategy to mean that offsetting GHG 
emissions is not an option. If so, that would imply that the “high gas” scenario has 
rather limited relevance for the current policy debate at the IMO.
Some studies suggest that LNG could play a transitional role. Under such a 
framework, LNG will be succeeded by compatible zero-carbon alternatives. One 
example of such a study is the “Zero-Emission Vessels: Transition Pathways” paper 
from Lloyd’s Register and UMAS (2019). This study concludes that LNG could be 
used as a bunker fuel in the 2020s—if this was part of a transition to LBM and LSM—
to remain competitive with other emerging zero-carbon bunker fuels.
DNV GL (2019) is the only study reviewed that explicitly models LBM and LSM 
as alternative bunker fuels. It includes two projection scenarios called “Focus on 
operational requirements” and “Focus on design requirements,” respectively. The 
first projection scenario, when applied to the DNV-GL model, predicts that LNG will 
be progressively replaced by LBM and LSM, both of which are zero-carbon fuels 
fully compatible with the existing LNG infrastructure. This would give LNG the status 
of a “transitional” fuel. In the second projection scenario, fossil LNG becomes a 
significant part of the bunker fuel mix up to the 2040s. After 2040, LNG will be 
replaced by non-compatible zero-carbon bunker fuels, particularly ammonia, 
making LNG a “temporary” fuel.
As highlighted in sub-section 2.1.2, DNV GL (2020b) further builds upon their 2019 
report by presenting 30 decarbonization scenarios, each with different pathways 
 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL 
12
and 2050 emission reduction outcomes. The report shows that when the least 
ambitious interpretation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy9 is complied with, LNG 
penetration rates in 2050 vary from zero to 30 percent. In return, when a more 
ambitious interpretation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy is implemented that is in 
line with achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals, then no LNG is utilized 
in the energy mix irrespective of the fuel price, shipping demand, and regulatory 
framework assumptions selected.
The International Energy Agency (IEA 2020a) also projects the global energy 
consumption for international shipping from 2019 to 2070. The projection is based 
upon their Sustainable Development Scenario, which is broadly consistent with the 
least ambitious interpretation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy targets. In this scenario, 
LNG use peaks in 2040 at five percent before gradually being displaced by zero-
carbon bunker fuels, such as ammonia, in the second half of the century. Therefore, 
it can be assumed that the IEA sees a limited role for LNG in the decarbonization of 
shipping, too.
Shell (2020) describes a number of long-term future fuel options: hydrogen (which 
they consider the most promising), ammonia, methanol, biofuels, batteries and 
nuclear energy. They consider LNG to be a promising fuel because an LNG-fueled 
vessel can also use other fuels (LBM and LSM). But they do not describe or quantify 
what they expect the long-run role of LNG to be. 
While there is no clear consensus across the studies examined above, they do 
broadly fall within a constrained set of categories:
	

The first category of studies expects the use of some form of liquefied methane 
gas in 2050, either as LNG (with carbon offsetting or without carbon offsetting), 
or as zero-carbon LBM or LSM. In this case, LNG would play a “transitional role” 
in shipping’s decarbonization.
	

A second category expects the temporary use of LNG until it is largely 
superseded by non-compatible zero-carbon bunker fuels in 2050. In this case, 
LNG would play a “temporary role” in shipping’s decarbonization.
	

A third category expects LNG to have no significant adoption. In this case, LNG 
would play a rather limited role as a marine fuel in shipping.
9	
The IMO Initial Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships refers to “at least 50 percent” reduction in 
absolute GHG emissions. A least ambitious interpretation is to assume that only a 50 percent reduction (the 
minimum) is achieved. This halving of emissions is approximately consistent with a proportionate response to 
holding temperatures no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. To meet the Paris Agreement’s 
temperature goal of holding temperature rise to well below two degrees Celsius and making efforts toward 1.5 
degrees Celsius, this minimum achievement would constitute a significant growth in shipping’s share of total GHG 
emissions. Without evidence that there will be greater GHG reductions occurring on average from other sources 
of anthropogenic emissions, shipping would therefore not be in line with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals.

Table 2 summarizes the results of the referenced studies. It is clear from even a 
cursory examination that these studies contain a range of results with no consensus 
on a single outcome. To explain this variability, sub-section 2.2 examines the 
differences in the assumptions adopted by these studies.
2.2	 KEY DRIVERS AND DIFFERENCES IN 
UPTAKE PROJECTIONS 
Many factors can affect the outcome of an uptake projection study. As can be seen 
from sub-section 2.1.1, even short-term projections are challenging because of the risk 
of misjudging underlying factors. To provide clarity on the possible market evolution 
of LNG, it is important to understand and quantify the driving factors that underpin 
these projections. This sub-section reviews additional studies (i.e., in addition to 
those shown in Table 2) that provide values for the various driving factors, with the 
aim of explaining some of the variance in the results.
The driving factors provided in the additional studies can be grouped into the following 
three categories: GHG impacts, macroeconomic considerations, and technological 
drivers. The studies reviewed are summarized in Table 3 and are discussed further in 
this section. Regulation is also an important factor that influences the uptake of LNG, 
but its influence is not discussed in the reviewed literature outside of those studies 
highlighted in Table 2. Therefore, section 2.2.4 ‘Regulatory measures’ includes a 
discussion of the papers highlighted in Table 2.

2.2.1	 GHG implications
While there is broad agreement on the potential benefit of LNG in terms of reducing 
air pollutants, the impact of LNG in terms of GHG emissions remains a point of 
contention. LNG contains up to 30 percent less carbon per unit of chemical energy 
(calorific value) than oil-derived bunker fuels, but there are significant uncertainties 
over its lifecycle GHG emissions. These uncertainties arise because the primary 
component of LNG is methane, which represents a potent GHG if released unburnt 
into the atmosphere. Any leakage of LNG (and hence methane) at any point in 
the fuel’s lifecycle must therefore be considered when evaluating the total GHG 
contribution of the fuel.
The potency of methane as a GHG depends on the timeframe under consideration. 
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric life, with its GHG effect diminishing 
over time. This means that the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of methane is 
approximately 2.5 times greater when measured on a 20-year basis than when 
measured on a 100-year time horizon (IPCC 2013). Over a 20-year timeframe, 
methane is 86 times more powerful than equivalent CO2, and over a 100-year 
timeframe it is 36 times more powerful (IPCC 2013). In the context of introducing 
new LNG-fueled vessels and retrofits to the market in the short term to meet the 
IMO GHG emissions reductions targets for 2050, this shorter-term (20-year) warming 
effect of methane appears as important as its long-term influence (100-year).
Based on the relevant studies, sub-section 2.2.1.1 provides an overview of the 
uncertainties related to LNG for each stage of its lifecycle.

 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL

The classification of LNG’s lifecycle GHG emissions in this report follows the 
terminology presented in Figure 4, and includes upstream, midstream, and 
downstream GHG emissions. For reference, these lifecycle stages are also known 
as “well-to-terminal,” “terminaI-to-tank,” and “tank-to-motion,” respectively.
At the upstream (“well-to-terminal”) stage, the uncertainty about the level of GHG 
emissions is dominated by the method of natural gas extraction. In particular, 
methane leakage may be higher for shale gas than for conventional natural gas 
extraction, due to the increased gas venting following high-volume hydraulic 
fracturing (ICCT 2020, based on findings from Howarth 2015). When separately 
estimated, midstream (“terminaI-to-tank”) GHG emissions are functions of utilization 
rates, distribution practices, and infrastructure development. They are driven by the 
operation of LNG feeder vessels and the associated refueling activities. These GHG 
emissions are typically assumed to decrease with time, as boil-off rates decrease 
with a higher throughput of LNG and as infrastructure technology improves (ICCT 
2013).
Overall, all studies find high uncertainty in upstream and midstream GHG emissions. 
Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO 2011) finds combined 
upstream and midstream emissions factors ranging from 11 to 23 gCO2eq/megajoule 
(MJ); European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC 2013) from 8 to 23 gCO2eq/
MJ; and ICCT (2013) from 4 to 33 gCO2eq/MJ. As a global average both Lindstad 
(2020) and Thinkstep (2019) use 18.5 gCO2eq/MJ. It must be noted that the difference 
between studies reflects the various assumptions in the pathways studied (location 
of production, method of extraction, transportation method, and liquefaction versus 
compression).
The majority of LNG’s lifecycle GHG emissions occur downstream, factoring in both 
combustion products (including unburnt methane) as well as the methane venting 
that can occur when maintaining safe fuel tank pressure or during cargo operations. 
These emissions are rapidly increasing, with downstream methane emissions from 
maritime transport growing by 151 percent between 2012 and 2018 despite only a 
28 percent increase in the use of LNG as a bunker fuel over the same time period 
(IMO 2020). At this stage, the majority of the uncertainty in GHG emissions levels 
arise from methane leakage that can occur in the combustion chamber of the ship’s 
engine. Vessels that use LNG as a primary fuel source can generally keep the 
internal fuel tank pressure low enough to avoid any undesired boil-off directly from 
the fuel tank, with venting occurring only when the ship is idle for extended periods. 
The literature review provided in Baresic et al. (2018) show that methane leakage 
in downstream vessel operation can lead to additional GHG emissions ranging 
from 2.2 gCO2eq/MJ for a diesel-cycle gas engine to 70 gCO2eq/MJ for a vessel 
operating at 25 percent load.
Overall, studies range in their estimates of the downstream emissions: TNO (2011) 
estimates 70 gCO2eq/MJ while ICCT (2013) uses 59 gCO2eq/MJ. Lindstad (2020) 
provides a range of downstream emissions ranging between 58 and 73 gCO2eq/MJ, 
while Thinkstep find downstream CO2eq emissions ranging from 60 to 71.3 gCO2eq/

2.2.1.2	 LNG’s lifecycle GHG emissions compared to conventional bunker fuels
LNG’s efficacy as a more environment-friendly substitute for heavy fuel oil (HFO) is 
closely tied to its air quality benefits, but also to its GHG emissions profile. For the 
latter, a significant part is determined by the method of natural gas extraction and 
scale of methane leakage.
As discussed previously, while methane is a potent GHG, its absolute potency 
depends on the timeframe under consideration. ICCT (2020) concludes that GHG 
emissions from LNG are highly sensitive to both the GWP time horizon and the 
onboard technology employed. Under a 100-year GWP horizon, the full lifecycle 
GHG emissions savings of LNG compared to low-sulfur heavy fuel oil (LSHFO) is 
estimated to be 16 percent. This assumes that any methane leakage is controlled, 
including by the use of high-pressure direct injection duaI-fuel (HPDF) engines 
 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL 
20
to control downstream emissions. ICCT (2020) figures show that, as of mid-2018, 
approximately 12 percent10 of all LNG vessels in operation and on order are equipped 
with HPDF engines. HDPF engines exhibit lower methane emissions than other types 
of LNG engine. According to ICCT (2020), measuring GHG impact with a 20-year 
GWP horizon fully eliminates the abatement potential of LNG, instead increasing its 
lifetime GHG emissions by two percent (relative to LSHFO) for HPDF vessels and up 
to 79 percent for cruise ships using standard medium-speed engines.
HPDF engines operate by first injecting a small quantity of marine diesel oil 
(MDO) fuel at the end of the compression stroke to initiate a combustion event 
in the same way as in a standard diesel cycle engine. The natural gas is 
then introduced into this initial combustion event via high pressure in cylinder 
injection, igniting the gas and producing the main combustion event and the 
propulsive power. The use of MDO combined with natural gas results in the 
duaI-fuel nomenclature. The high-pressure injection needed to add and mix 
sufficient natural gas results in the high-pressure part of the designation.
When considering methane emissions, this approach has two main advantages 
that stem from how the natural gas is introduced, mixed, and burnt at the end 
of the compression stroke in a HPDF engine. First, no natural gas, and hence 
methane, can escape during the air induction phase because the natural gas 
is introduced when the inlet and exhaust ports/values are closed. Second, the 
natural gas is kept away from the crevices and the relatively cold walls of the 
combustion chamber where combustion cannot happen. In engines where 
the natural gas is introduced with the combustion air, these poor combustion 
regions lead to unburnt natural gas and its major constituent methane being 
emitted to the atmosphere via the exhaust phase.
2.2.2	 Macroeconomic considerations
The uptake of LNG as a bunker fuel will depend on its relative competitiveness, 
particularly with regards to price. The degree of near-term uptake of LNG is therefore 
a function of the current and future price of LNG relative to the price of conventional 
oil-derived bunker fuels. 
Previously, weak LNG uptake has been attributed to an insufficient price differential 
between LNG and HFO, combined with cost and space claim challenges (see below 
in 2.2.3) in installing the necessary onboard equipment (SEA-LNG 2020). Whilst 
natural gas has had price advantages relative to crude oil, HFO is also cheaper than 
crude oil. Therefore, the added vessel capital costs of using LNG as a bunker fuel 
requires LNG to have a consistent lower minimum price margin relative to HFO in 
order to justify its use. This price differential varies depending on a number of factors 
10	
Please note, this percentage represents the proportion of the LNG-powered fleet that use HPDF engines. This is 
not analogous to the proportion of the LNG fuel consumed by the LNG fleet due to differences in vessel size and 
duty cycles.

including the payback period required, the installation costs specific to the vessel 
design and shipyard, and the equipment costs. Thus, it is difficult to generalize the 
magnitude by which LNG needs to be cheaper than HFO for a clear commercial 
driver to emerge – except that price differentials as shown in Figure 5 have not 
resulted in significant orders of LNG-fueled vessels to date (see sub-section 2.1.1).
Another challenge that hinders the ability to identify a commercially viable investment 
is that the price differential is very difficult to predict due to the complexities of the 
geopolitical landscape and the globalized market for oil and gas. This prediction 
difficulty is shown in Figure 5, where the crude oil price is used as proxy for the HFO 
price given that HFO is a product of crude oil refining. The equivalent data are not 
presented for HFO price as no similar benchmark prices are available.
Considerable fluctuations in the price spread between natural gas and crude oil can 
be observed over time and across geographic regions. Regional price differences 
are in part due to natural gas pricing mechanisms differing across world regions. For 
example, in the United States, natural gas prices are disconnected from the crude 
oil reference. In Europe, the share of natural gas sold with reference to the price at 
European gas trading hubs is growing. In the Asia-Pacific region, the natural gas 
price is fixed within the long-term crude oil-indexed contracts (TNO 2014).

Estimating the future price differential between natural gas and any other fossil-
derived bunker fuels becomes even more challenging when considering the 
potential future uptake of various alternative zero-carbon bunker fuels, such as 
ammonia or hydrogen. In the short term, it therefore seems unlikely that the maritime 
industry will receive a high-certainty commercial signal that unleashes the large-
scale investment in LNG necessary for significant uptake.
 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL 
22
2.2.3	 Technological requirements
The lifetime GHG emissions and the total cost of LNG vary considerably depending 
on the pathway that is taken from the extraction well to the vessel, as well as the 
onboard technology used to store and burn the LNG. Some of the drivers for this 
variability are related to technology differences in the ships and infrastructure, 
which are discussed in greater detail below.
LNG has a variety of uses in the global economy, of which maritime transport is a 
rather small component. As displayed by Figure 6, less than one percent of global 
natural gas demand originates from international bunker fuels (IEA 2020b). For this 
reason, the discussion of technology and investment is typically limited to the mid- 
and downstream stages of LNG’s lifecycle pathways. This is always based on the 
assumption that the use of LNG in shipping will remain a rather small proportion of 
global LNG consumption, and that shipping will accordingly have consistent access 
to independent upstream facilities.

There are at least eight pathways for LNG, from being deposited at a large import 
terminal to a vessel’s fuel tank (ICCT 2013). Yet, one is assumed by Baresic et al. 
(2018) to be the most likely to occur due to its supply flexibility and low costs. On 
that pathway, a feeder vessel (~10,000m3 capacity) is used to perform ship-to-ship 
refueling directly from the import terminal to LNG-fueled vessels, and is ideally 
suited to ships requiring over 100m3 of bunkering fuel. The resulting short turn-around 
times preclude the need for any intermediate storage. For small inland waterway 
vessels using LNG, the most likely pathways involve small LNG barges (~3,000m3

23
capacity) delivering LNG from the import terminal to small intermediate storage 
units in less navigable routes. While the use of LNG as a bunker fuel can leverage 
LNG’s existing global supply chain and infrastructure, its costs and implications still 
need to be taken into account when assessing LNG’s application within the shipping 
sector. Capital infrastructure costs depend on the associated pathways and add a 
component of cost to the scenarios as a function of the total amount of infrastructure 
needed specific to LNG’s use as a bunker fuel. Appendix C provides further details 
derived from a research project by the Danish Maritime Authority (DMA 2012).
Installing equipment and operating an LNG-fueled vessel poses complications 
relative to a typical fuel oil-powered equivalent vessel, with the primary issue 
arising from the size of the fuel tank required. The energy-density ratio between 
the two fuels is 1.6, meaning that a larger volume of LNG must be burnt to generate 
the same amount of energy. Moreover, the cryogenic storage temperatures of LNG 
require a heavily insulated tank, which in turn takes up an even greater volume of 
storage space on LNG-fueled vessels. These large tanks are challenging to retrofit 
into existing vessels, and the larger fuel tanks also leave less volume for cargo, 
narrowing the range of vessels that can economically use LNG for trade.
2.2.4	 Regulatory measures
Scenario modelling, including as in Baresic et al. (2018), indicates that LNG uptake 
may be highly sensitive to the price differential between LNG and conventional oil-
derived bunker fuel options and alternative fuels. For example, when Baresic et al. 
(2018) apply a range of LNG prices in different scenarios with approximately a ten 
percent range (the range between upper and lower bound prices), this leads to a 
large variability in the uptake of LNG between scenarios—including in the period 
before the implementation of policy to reduce GHG emissions to control for the 
influence of policy on uptake.
In practice, this price differential is also influenced by the higher infrastructure capital 
expenditure and reduced global refueling options currently associated with LNG. 
Since maritime transport accounts for only a small portion of total worldwide LNG 
demand, its price is primarily determined by factors outside of the maritime industry’s 
control. As maritime policymakers cannot effectively influence prices, regulations 
governing GHG emissions, air pollutant emissions, and energy efficiency are the 
only policy mechanisms that can ensure the relative competitiveness of LNG. Some 
of the variation in the results of the studies considered in sub-section 2.1 come from 
the different assumptions regarding these policy objectives (mainly air pollution and 
climate mitigation), the geographic levels at which these policies are implemented 
(globally, regionally, nationally, or locally), and their stringency.
Two main air pollution policies are considered by the studies reviewed in sub-
section 2.1. The first penalizes the use of conventional oil-derived bunker fuels 
through Emission Control Areas (ECA) where stricter controls are implemented to 
reduce air pollutant emissions from ships (SOx, PM, and NOx). The second applies 
a global sulfur cap for bunker fuels from 2020 (Baresic et al. 2018; Lloyd’s Register 
 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL 
24
2012; Lloyd’s Register and UMAS 2019; and DNV GL 2019). Lloyd’s Register and 
UMAS show, through surveys of tanker owners, that in the short term low-sulfur 
bunker fuels such as low sulfur heavy fuel oil (LSHFO) are likely to be favored to 
ensure compliance with these air pollutant emissions regulations, while abatement 
technologies will become more relevant in the medium term. However, LNG is 
generally viewed as a viable long-term compliance option (Lloyd’s Register and 
UMAS 2019).
The details of specific future climate-related regulatory measures are uncertain, 
and the variation in assumptions in the scenarios considered reflect this uncertainty. 
For instance, the main potential regulatory measures considered in the studies 
reviewed include:
	

Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) regulation: a policy tool restricting the 
construction of new-build vessels that exceed certain carbon intensity limits. 
Currently, LNG is considered an effective means to comply with the EEDI as only 
downstream CO2 emissions are accounted for within this policy framework. This 
automatically gives LNG a 30 percent lower CO2 emission per unit of propulsion 
(ICCT 2020). DNV GL’s (2019) “Focus on design requirements” scenario assumes 
the adoption of more stringent requirements in the EEDI by 2040.
	

Operational requirements: regulation which applies to all existing ships rather 
than only newbuilds and includes mandatory energy efficiency measures, 
speed reduction, and supply-chain optimization. Both scenarios in DNV GL 
(2019) assume the implementation of operational requirements, with differing 
levels of stringency.
	

Market-based measures: a policy that usually comes in the form of carbon 
pricing. These measures are assumed by several studies like Baresic et al. 
(2018) and Lloyd’s Register and UMAS (2019).
	

Carbon offsetting: a mechanism that compensates for GHG emissions occurring 
in one sector by avoiding them in another sector. Carbon offsetting is included in 
selected scenarios of Baresic et al. (2018).
Varying the stringency of these potential regulatory measures is shown to have a 
significant effect on the uptake of LNG.
The “business as usual” case in Baresic et al. (2018) assumes that existing regulatory 
measures included in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution 
from Ships (MARPOL)—for example, EEDI, global ECAs, and global emissions 
caps on sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) —remain in place. The other 
scenarios in Baresic et al. (2018) introduce market-based measures in 2025 and 
2030 in the form of carbon pricing, with linkages to carbon offset markets capped 
at 20 to 30 percent of revenue generated from the carbon pricing. These variations 
in the regulatory assumptions are the dominant source of the large variation in the 
LNG uptake across the four scenarios, which ranges from 3 to 61 percent of the fuel 
market by 2050 in energy terms.
 VOLUME 2: THE ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
25
In the absence of a commercial signal giving the maritime industry high certainty, 
regulation may provide a consistent multi-year incentive to invest in a particular 
fuel or technology. The various ECA air quality limits are an example of such a 
policy mechanism. However, while LNG provides inherent SOx, NOx, and particulate 
matter (PM) benefits, the traditional oil-derived bunker fuels can still comply with the 
current global and ECA air quality regulations, too. Compliance can be achieved 
through the addition of proven emissions control technologies such as Selective 
Catalytic Reduction or Exhaust Gas Recirculation. This possibility suggests that ECA 
air quality limits are unlikely to provide a sufficiently strong stimulus for the uptake 
of LNG.
Another potential legislative driver for LNG is the IMO’s EEDI. Currently, this 
regulatory framework is used to improve the carbon intensity of vessels through 
an assessment process and various staged targets. The framework allows for the 
use of LNG and only accounts for the downstream (operational) CO2 emissions. 
Accordingly, it assigns a greater GHG emissions benefit to LNG than its true 
lifecycle GHG emissions may allow for. For the EEDI, the primary advantage of LNG 
stems in part from this policy loophole of not including methane emissions, which is 
likely to be closed in future legislative rounds. New regulations on carbon intensity 
targeted at the existing fleet and operational carbon intensity regulation are due to 
be adopted at IMO at MEPC 76 (June 2021). However, given LNG is predominantly 
a newbuild technology, its main potential driver is expected to remain the EEDI 
regulation rather than these new regulations. 
Until the loophole is closed, EEDI regulation may create some incentive for LNG. 
However, in its current form newbuild container ships, LNG carriers, and general 
cargo ships will see an EEDI stringency increase in 2022, brought forward because 
of evidence that many ships of these types being built are already achieving the 
2025-required EEDI levels. The remaining fleet will not see a stringency increase 
until 2025. Therefore, whilst the EEDI could theoretically drive the uptake of LNG 
vessels, this is unlikely to be a sufficiently strong driver before 2025, a point at 
which the landscape of zero-carbon bunker fuels should have further clarified 
making it easier to judge what to invest in for long-run commercial viability. The 
EEDI is therefore considered unlikely to drive strong uptake of LNG in the short-term 
future either. 
In return, a development that is likely to considerably affect the uptake of LNG is 
the Initial IMO GHG Strategy. However, it appears unlikely that this policy will spur 
large investments in LNG since its GHG emissions reduction targets are unlikely to 
be compatible with the use of LNG alone. The existing literature, for example ICS 
(2018), is fairly consistent on this point, especially if the offsetting of GHG emissions is 
excluded and a 20-year global warming potential is used to calculate the lifecycle 
CO2eq emissions associated with methane leakage.
In summary, while existing regulations and the Initial IMO GHG Strategy may provide 
some incentive to adopt LNG in shipping, they are unlikely to be sufficiently strong to 
drive a significant uptake of LNG as a bunker fuel in maritime transport. In addition, 
 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A BUNKER FUEL 
26
the Initial IMO GHG Strategy is also not likely to spur a significant uptake of LNG. 
Without a significant growth in demand for LNG as a bunker fuel, large investments 
in infrastructure supplying LNG to ships do not appear very likely either.
2.3	 LESSONS LEARNED
The main lesson to be learned from section 2 is that there is a lack of consensus 
in the reviewed literature on the possible role of LNG in the decarbonization of 
international shipping; this lack of consensus is largely explained by the various 
modelling assumptions used in these studies. Studies can “cherry-pick” from a broad 
range of assumptions regarding emissions factors, macroeconomic considerations, 
technology pathways, and regulatory measures. This selective process can then 
be used to create seemingly credible narratives for a wide range of LNG uptake 
outcomes. In reviewing and understanding the assumptions used, this report has 
made a first step to move beyond this current situation.
The report also does not find any clear, strong, and unambiguous driver (including 
macroeconomic or regulatory incentives) which currently point at LNG's large-scale 
uptake as bunker fuel in the short term, if the decarbonization targets set in the Initial 
IMO GHG Strategy are to be met.

3.	 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A 
TRANSITIONAL FUEL 
Section 2 shed light on why the role of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the 
decarbonization of shipping is a contested issue in the literature. This section argues 
that there are good compelling reasons to believe that LNG is unlikely to play a 
transitional role. In particular, it highlights significant supply constraints for zero-
carbon bunker fuels that are compatible with LNG to satisfy the energy demand 
from international shipping.
3.1	  COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
Although significant uncertainty and variability remain in the literature around LNG’s 
lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there is a broad consensus amongst the 
studies reviewed that the transition to fossil LNG alone will fall short of achieving the 
International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) stated 2050 GHG emissions reduction 
target. Some studies therefore suggest a shift to fully compatible net-zero carbon 
bunker fuels that can reuse LNG infrastructure.
However, re-using LNG infrastructure for zero-carbon bunker fuels, such as ammonia 
and hydrogen, would require extensive retrofitting. For example, although both 
LNG and hydrogen require cryogenic treatment, the fuels’ storage temperatures 
are far apart (-160°C and -253°C, respectively) and require different designs, 
and containment and cooling equipment to be installed (Lloyd’s Register 2020). 
There may also be different safety considerations, given that these fuels present 
different hazards around explosivity, corrosivity, and toxicity (Lloyd’s Register 2020). 
Therefore, any LNG infrastructure is likely to play a transitional role for liquefied 
biomethane (LBM) and liquefied synthetic methane (LSM) fuels only.
 28
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TRANSITIONAL FUEL 
Part of the controversy in the existing literature on the role of LNG in decarbonizing 
shipping is due to whether LNG-compatible zero-carbon bunker fuels are assumed 
to be viable options for shipping. Several studies consider LBM and/or LSM as 
possibilities (DNV GL 2019; Lloyd’s Register and UMAS 2019; and Oxford Institute for 
Energy Studies 2018). In addition, DNV GL (2019) explicitly assumes that LBM and/
or LSM will be available in sufficient quantities to replace fossil LNG. The remaining 
studies do not assume LBM and/or LSM as an option (Baresic et al. 2018 and Lloyd’s 
Register 2012).
3.2	 VIABILITY CONSTRAINTS
Proponents of the use of LNG as a transitional fuel suggest that any LNG infrastructure 
can be utilized by compatible zero-carbon fuels such as LBM and LSM. This sub-
section argues that LNG is unlikely to play a transitional role since there are serious 
concerns about the availability of sustainably sourced LBM for shipping, and since 
LSM is unlikely to become a cost-competitive bunker fuel. If LBM and LSM did 
not turn out to be viable zero-carbon bunker fuel options, LNG could not play a 
transitional role leading to its widespread adoption.
3.2.1	 Constraints to the viability of liquefied biomethane as a 
bunker fuel
The availability of sustainable biomass feedstock—a critical determinant of whether 
LBM can become a significant bunker fuel in the future—is uncertain. Two factors 
govern the availability of biofuels such as LBM for shipping. The first is the quantity 
that can be sustainably produced. The second is cross-sectoral competition for the 
available biomass from other sectors in a future decarbonized economy. A realistic 
assessment must account for both factors.
Regarding the first factor, total future global biofuel production is uncertain. A 
general consensus among experts is that around 70 to 160 exajoules (EJ) of energy 
could be produced from sustainable biomass in 2050 (CCC 2018; Smith et al. 2014; 
and IPCC 2018). IEA (2020a), whilst providing an estimate for 2070 rather than 2050, 
is also reasonably consistent with this range, quoting a feasible range of 100 to 200 
EJ of sustainable biomass supply. However, the full range quoted in the literature 
appears much wider, ranging from 30 to 500 EJ (Winning et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 
2018; and IPCC 2018). For LBM specifically, CE Delft (2020) forecasts the maximum 
conceivable supply in 2050 and estimates that between 37 and 184 EJ could be 
feasibly produced in a sustainable manner. Finally, Pye et al. (2019) estimate a total 
LBM production potential (including from waste sources) in 2050 at 34 EJ, which is in 
line with the lower bound of CE Delft (2002). These figures contrast with this report’s 
estimated energy demand for shipping of approximately 20 EJ in 2050 (see Figure 
13, page 44).
 VOLUME 2: ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
29
Regarding the second factor, cross-sector competition for biomass and related 
biofuels is likely as these are versatile commodities that can be used to decarbonize 
a number of economic sectors. Often, competing sectors may be either more efficient 
users of the biomass (power generation, afforestation, negative emissions, plastic 
demand, and heating), or sectors such as aviation where the economic value of an 
energy-dense drop-in fuel may be even more pressing than in the maritime industry. 
However, the evolution of these global demand markets out to 2050 is not a settled 
issue in the current literature.
A number of demand scenarios exist at an energy system level, with the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2018), for instance, providing 
the total primary energy requirement and the biomass availability for their 1.5°C 
scenarios. Under the assumptions made in their report, the share of bioenergy is 
expected to increase to around 15 to 25 percent of total energy supply. Despite 
electrification, bioenergy continues to be important to industry, building, and 
transport sectors (with heavy-duty vehicles and aviation representing major demand 
sectors), while biomass combustion for electrical power in combination with carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) provides a “carbon sink” for net reductions in atmospheric 
carbon dioxide (CO2). In this scenario, approximately 6 to 22 EJ of biofuels would be 
available for the total transport sector (IPCC 2018).
The IPCC’s whole energy system view is further supported by the more recent work 
of the IEA (2020a), where bioenergy represents 20 percent of primary energy in 
2070 in their “Sustainable Development Scenario”. This primary energy supply is 
exposed to a similar mix of demands as described by IPCC (2018), resulting in 16 
EJ of energy being made available to the total transport sector. That total includes 
bioenergy obtained from cultivation for energy use as well as bioenergy derived 
from waste sources.
In the IEA “Sustainable Development Scenario,” this total transport sector supply is 
further sub-divided into a resulting biofuel energy use in shipping of approximately 
1.6 EJ. Compared to a total energy use estimated by IEA of just 8.4 EJ by shipping 
in 2050 (much lower than the approximately 20 EJ estimated in this report), this 
implies that biofuels could cover approximately 15 percent of the quoted total 
shipping energy demand maximum. Therefore, meeting shipping’s energy demand 
using mostly biofuels such as LBM seems a challenging proposition. This conclusion 
is also echoed by Shell (2020). Whilst not presenting a quantitative assessment, 
the study states: “Biofuels are considered unlikely to be the dominant future fuel 
for shipping. This is because the sector would need huge volumes [of biofuels], and 
other sectors such as aviation and road transport are likely to be more able to pay 
the cost.”
In Figure 7, Sustainable Shipping Initiative (2019) highlights the bioenergy availability 
with the likely demand from a range of sectors, neatly summarizing the challenge of 
meeting significant shipping demand with biofuels.

A further threat to the viability of LBM in shipping is its competitiveness relative to 
other options in terms of total cost of operation. Total cost of operation includes, 
for example, the costs of the fuel as supplied at a bunkering terminal, the cost 
implications of installing the technologies to use the fuel onboard, the cost of 
implications for cargo capacity, and so forth. Lloyd’s Register and UMAS (2020) 
estimate that the total cost of operation of biomethanol-powered ships in the short 
term (up to 2030) will be approximately one-half the total cost of ownership of an 
LBM-powered ship. Both types of biofuels—biomethanol and LBM—have significant 
overlap in their respective feedstock (crops and agricultural residues). Therefore, 
from a competitiveness perspective, it is likely more cost-effective to use such 
feedstock for a zero-carbon bunker fuel such as biomethanol, with lower total cost 
of ownership than LBM.
 VOLUME 2: ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
31
To summarize, several studies (IPCC 2018; IEA 2020a; and Shell 2020) call into 
question whether sustainable biomass will be available in the large quantities 
needed to cover shipping’s zero-carbon energy needs. Next to the challenge of 
scalability, there are also uncertainties that whatever supply may appear may not 
be cost-competitive relative to other options. This does not mean that there would 
be no prospects for the supply of LBM at all, but LBM may not necessarily be the 
first choice for the sector. It could rather be seen as a fallback for those owners who 
may have no option to easily retrofit their vessels to the zero-carbon fuel option 
favored by the majority of the market.
3.2.2	 Constraints to the viability of green liquefied synthetic 
methane as a bunker fuel 
In theory, LSM appears much less constrained than LBM in terms of supply and 
represents a very scalable fuel. LSM is produced by combining zero-carbon 
hydrogen and atmospheric carbon to synthesize methane. In the future, large 
quantities of zero-carbon hydrogen are likely to be produced via renewable 
electricity. In turn, this means that the limit on zero-carbon hydrogen production is 
likely to be the availability of renewable electricity. Obtaining sufficient quantities of 
atmospheric CO2 will also not present an issue.
The primary constraint on LSM’s viability appears to be its cost, which arises from 
two factors. The first is that the direct air capture (DAC) technology used to capture 
carbon for synthesis still has uncertain capital expenditure costs. In addition, the CO2 
extraction process requires a significant amount of energy which needs to be paid for 
and considered. The second constraint is that a significant quantity of input energy 
is required to combine the carbon (from the CO2) with the zero-carbon hydrogen 
to create green LSM. These processes are likely to make LSM significantly more 
expensive, including on a total cost-of-operation basis, than zero-carbon hydrogen 
or ammonia and ultimately less attractive from an economic perspective (Volume 1: 
The Potential of Zero-Carbon Bunker Fuels in Developing Countries, see Preamble).
The related Volume 1 (see Preamble) reviewed a large number of existing studies 
on alternative zero-carbon bunker fuel options and shortlisted candidate bunker 
fuels most likely to dominate the 2040s and 2050s. Both LBM and LSM variants 
of natural gas were considered, but consistent with Lloyd’s Register and UMAS 
(2017) and Lloyd’s Register and UMAS (2020) these fuels were not found to 
be economically competitive in the long run. The two options showing the most 
favorable results against the criteria defined were ammonia and hydrogen. These 
latter fuels, however, will need infrastructure, onboard technologies, and hence 
capital investments that are not aligned with investments in LNG infrastructure and 
technology for shipping.

LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TRANSITIONAL FUEL 
3.3	 LESSONS LEARNED
In summary, section 3 has illustrated that there are good reasons to believe that LNG 
is unlikely to play a transitional role in the decarbonization of shipping. Two main 
arguments support this statement. First, there are likely severe constraints to the 
sustainable supply of compatible biofuels, such as LBM, that is one option allowing 
the reuse of LNG infrastructure in the shipping sector. Therefore, the profitability of 
investments in LNG infrastructure cannot rely on the reuse of this infrastructure for 
other fuels. Second, other LNG-compatible zero-carbon bunker fuels such as green 
LSM are expected to be less attractive from an economic perspective than their 
direct competitors such as hydrogen and ammonia.
This also suggests that LNG may play only a temporary or limited role in the short-
term decarbonization of the shipping sector. To provide further data to test this 
conclusion, the next section attempts to quantify what a significant deployment of 
LNG’s use as a bunker fuel would look like. Specifically, section 4 looks at LNG as 
a temporary fuel (that is, Future 2: “Temporary role for LNG” as noted above) and 
quantifies the GHG emissions and financial implications across a range of scenarios.

4.	 LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A 
TEMPORARY FUEL
Section 4 presents an estimate of the greenhouse gas (GHG) impact, required capital 
expenditures, and GHG and economic risks associated with deploying a liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) fleet and related infrastructure on a temporary basis. In light of the 
International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2050 climate target, this section seeks 
to answer the following guiding questions:
1.	 GHG implications: What would be the potential short-term consequences for 
GHG emissions from ships if LNG was used as a temporary fuel at large scale 
(that is greater than 10 percent of the fuel mix in energy terms)?
2.	 Financial implications: How much additional investment would be needed to 
deploy the corresponding infrastructure and fleet if LNG served as a temporary 
large-scale fuel?
3.	 Risk implications: What may be the potential risk of stranded assets associated 
with LNG as a temporary fuel?
4.	 Technology “lock-in” implications: What could be the consequences of an 
LNG technology pathway “lock-in”?
To address these questions, three sets of LNG uptake cases have been developed, 
modelled, and examined. Of the three uptake cases presented in Table 5 the 
“Baseline” and “Near-term substitution” cases achieve the climate targets of the Initial 
IMO GHG Strategy as modelled in the Global Transport Model (GloTraM), a techno-
economic model of the global freight transport system, focused on international 
shipping. While Case I has been linked to Future 3 expecting “a limited role for 
LNG”, Cases II and III have been derived from Future 2 assuming “a temporary role 
for LNG”. The prospects of Future 1 suggesting “a transitional role for LNG” have 
already been discussed and discounted earlier.

Sections 2 and 3 of this report provide relevant references and reasoning 
that suggest that LNG’s short-term and long-term roles as a propulsion fuel 
for international shipping may be rather limited. In practice, this means that the 
“Baseline” case should be considered the most likely outcome in the maritime 
transport sector. In contrast, the “Near-term substitution” and “Long-term lock-in” 
cases represent theoretical “what if” cases designed to highlight the implications 
of a significant LNG uptake up to 2030. The relative likelihoods of these Cases II 
and III are not important for this assessment. Case II, “Near-term substitution,” is 
used to answer questions one and two, and Case III, “Long-term lock-in,” addresses 
questions three and four. The detailed assumptions used within the three cases 
modelled by GloTraM and the model’s credentials can be found in Appendix A. 
These assumptions are deemed to be the most appropriate or the most likely to 
occur.
The actual decarbonization trajectory of the international maritime fleet is currently 
unknown as it is a function of a myriad of policy, commercial, and technological 
outcomes. Therefore, on top of these three cases, two major decarbonization 
scenarios, both consistent with interpretations of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, are 
considered. The first considers “full decarbonization by 2050,” and the second a 
50 percent GHG emissions reduction by 2050 with “full decarbonization by 2070.” 
These two scenarios are included to test for potential sensitivity of the results to the 
stringency of the case and the speed of decarbonization. In all cases considered, 
the assessment applies a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 25 for 
methane leakage. This GWP is even more conservative than the IPCC revised GWP 
for methane (that is, 36 over a 100-year period) and enables the modelling in this 
assessment to remain consistent with the referenced studies and data sources.
11	
 This is equivalent to the least-cost decarbonization scenario in UMAS (2020).
 VOLUME 2: ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
35
This analysis assumes that there is currently a reasonable likelihood of either 
decarbonization—by 2050 or 2070—trajectory. On the one hand, full decarbonization 
by 2070 is a likely scenario as it results in approximately a 50 percent reduction 
in absolute GHG emissions by 2050, which is a stated ambition in the Initial IMO 
GHG Strategy. On the other hand, these ambitions may be increased when the IMO 
agrees its revisions to the Initial IMO GHG Strategy in 2023, and conducts further 
reviews every five years. This is because of the higher GHG reduction imperative 
(across all sectors) provided by the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals (UNFCCC 
2016), the explicit link to the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals made in the 
Initial IMO GHG Strategy, and the increasing numbers of governments setting their 
domestic GHG emissions reduction objectives to be in line with reaching zero GHG 
emissions by 2050 (or in some cases even sooner).
Furthermore, major commercial shipping stakeholders such as Maersk, BP, and Shell 
have already made commitments to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across 
their operations by 2050, strengthening the full decarbonization commitment of the 
shipping sector by or shortly after 2050 (Maersk 2019, BP n.d., and Shell n.d.). Others 
like the BW Group, which owns and operates one of the world’s largest gas shipping 
fleet, or Trafigura, one of the largest ship charterers, have called for the IMO to 
facilitate an economically viable decarbonization route for the industry by adopting 
a carbon price on bunker fuels (BW Group et al. 2019, Trafigura 2020). However, 
stakeholder actions are not limited to individual organizations. Many forward-
looking industry players have joined the Getting to Zero Coalition, which works 
toward “commercially viable zero-emissions vessels operating along deep-sea 
trade routes by 2030, supported by the necessary infrastructure for scalable zero-
carbon energy sources including production, distribution, storage and bunkering” 
(Getting to Zero Coalition 2019). This has already led to the development of common 
industry-wide decarbonization frameworks, such as the Poseidon Principles or the 
Sea Cargo Charter, highlighting how the industry strives to make progress on aligning 
its operations and financing with the IMO’s climate targets (Poseidon Principles n.d., 
and Sea Cargo Charter n.d.).
 4.1	
GHG IMPLICATIONS
What would be the potential short-term consequences for GHG emissions from ships 
if LNG was deployed as a temporary fuel at large scale?
A recent study commissioned by the Global Maritime Forum (see UMAS 2020) 
estimates the evolution of the international maritime fleet for both the 2050 and the 
2070 decarbonization scenarios. Both scenarios forecast a massive uptake of zero-
carbon ammonia to achieve these decarbonization objectives, and only a niche 
uptake of LNG (see Figure 10 on page 39). As a result, these scenarios can be 
used to create a baseline fleet evolution from now until 2050 that uses little LNG 
(the “Baseline” case). This baseline maritime fleet provides a viable GHG emissions 
pathway and is used as the basis for calculating the impact of additional LNG use 
on GHG emissions from ships.
 36
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
To calculate the GHG impact of LNG, a contrasting case with LNG as a temporary 
fuel (“Near-term substitution” case) is created by forcing the adoption of LNG-fueled 
vessels into the international maritime fleet. For that purpose, the LNG adoption rate 
is set at 100 percent for newbuilds after 2021, thus mimicking the implementation of 
either an extremely effective policy mechanism, or the presence of an overwhelming 
commercial benefit. This means that any ship built after 2021, that uses fossil fuel in 
the “Baseline” case, is an LNG powered vessel within the “Near-term substitution” 
case.
To ensure that the “Near term substitution” fleet still achieves full decarbonization by 
2050 or 2070, the LNG vessels are either retrofitted or superseded by zero-carbon 
vessels, which are mainly ammonia-powered (see section 4.2.2 for further details 
and Figure 13 for the fleet fuel use versus time). Again, this mimics the implementation 
of an effective policy decarbonization policy or significant commercial benefits. By 
calculating the evolution of GHG emissions in this “Near-term substitution” case, a 
direct comparison can be made to the “Baseline” case.
As discussed previously, the GHG benefits of using LNG are uncertain and depend 
on the pathways for sourcing LNG and the type of LNG engines installed on board. 
This uncertainty is represented by the assumption of differing emissions factors—
that is gCO2eq/megajoule (MJ)—across the reviewed studies as discussed in sub-
section 2.2.1.1, and illustrated in Table 4.
From these studies, an upper and lower bound for total lifecycle emissions factors 
are derived and the potential GHG emissions implications computed. The emissions 
factor ranges used are shown in Appendix B. By combining the proposed range of 
emissions factors with the contrasting LNG uptake “Near-term substitution” case, the 
GHG impact of a temporary, but significant, LNG adoption case can be calculated.
Figure 8 illustrates the evolution of pure CO2 emissions where the impacts of any 
methane leakage are ignored and where decarbonization is achieved by 2050. 
Figure 8 shows that under idealized conditions a significant, but relatively moderate, 
GHG benefit could be generated across the modelled international maritime fleet, 
peaking at a 15 percent benefit in 2031.12 
12	
The modelling is undertaken in time steps of five years and under the assumption of a linear evolution of relevant 
parameters between each time step. This explains why a gradual change is observed after 2016 leading up to the 
first modelled time step in 2021. The last modelled time step is 2051. This description of the modelling approach 
also applies to all subsequent results presented in section 4.

LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
Figure 9 accounts for methane leakage and shows the lifecycle CO2eq GHG 
emissions for the scenario where decarbonization is achieved by 2070. Figure 9 
shows that even in an idealized case, with significant market uptake of LNG, a longer 
decarbonization timeframe (decarbonization by 2070 rather than by 2050), and 
optimistic assumptions regarding LNG’s potential for GHG reductions, the estimated 
GHG benefits of eight percent are not transformative relative to the baseline.
Figure 9 also demonstrates that once methane leakage is accounted for, using the 
range of emissions factors present across the literature, the GHG benefits of LNG 
are significantly diminished. Indeed, under the high methane emissions assumption, 
the use of LNG may even result in an increase of nine percent in GHG emissions. 
This provides support for urgent and strong policy action to regulate methane 
emissions both in the supply chain of LNG and in its use on board ships. Only such 
regulation could help avoid a worst-case scenario where a shift to LNG increases 
GHG emissions instead of reducing them. Such regulation would become even 
more important if the maritime transport sector’s move away from fossil fuel use 
in the maritime fleet turned out to be slower in reality compared to the scenarios 
anticipated here.
Given the expected peak of the GHG benefits generated by LNG in the 2030s, 
considering the 20-year GWP of methane appears relevant. Under these 
circumstances, the GWP of methane changes from 25 to 86. Due to limitations in 
input flexibility in the modelling used to test this sensitivity case, the GWP change 
can be implemented on downstream emissions only. This change in perspective 
further diminishes the GHG benefits of the LNG uptake “Near-term substitution” 
case. In 2031, the GWP change on downstream alone causes CO2eq emissions 
to increase from 1.16 to 1.45 billion tons (+25 percent) under the “‘high methane 
emissions” assumption. Under the “low methane emissions” assumption, CO2eq 
emissions increase from 1 to 1.12 billion tons (+12 percent). When a GWP of 86 is 
adopted for methane, even the “low methane emissions” assumption provides no 
material benefit over the “Baseline” case.
The modelling above shows that uncertainties around input variables such as 
emissions factors for methane mean that a range of possible GHG emissions are 
associated with deploying LNG in the “Near-term substitution” case. In no case 
is the generated GHG benefit transformative. For example, depending on the 
methane leakage assumptions used, the LNG market penetration would result in 
a GHG benefit of eight percent in 2030 in the optimistic case. In contrast, under 
conservative assumptions CO2eq emissions from a significant LNG uptake may turn 
out to be nine percent higher in 2030 than the baseline. This analysis suggests that 
the expectation that short- to mid-term use of LNG would provide a significant GHG 
benefit appears to be questionable.

 4.2	 FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
4.2.1	 Investments required to decarbonize international shipping
What is the scale of investment needed to decarbonize international shipping?
The investment cost of the LNG uptake “Baseline” case is taken from UMAS (2020). 
This is the same set of international maritime fleet evolutions as used in sub-section 
4.1. UMAS (2020) estimates the investment costs for the two decarbonization 
scenarios (by 2050 and by 2070) over the fuel pathways shown in Figure 9. As 
mentioned previously, the modelling of both scenarios finds a significant uptake 
of ammonia to achieve the decarbonization objectives, and only a niche uptake of 
LNG. As a result, these scenarios can be used to understand the investment needed 
for the “Baseline” case (based on Future 3: “A limited role for LNG”). This “Baseline” 
case assumes a single-stage conversion, meaning a direct shift from oil-derived 
fuels to zero-carbon ammonia produced by either renewable electricity or natural 
gas in conjunction with carbon capture and storage (CCS).

LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
The scope of the assessment includes the capital expenditures necessary to 
build the upstream, midstream, and downstream infrastructure from the point of 
energy availability to the supply of bunker fuel to the vessel. For instance, the 
capital expenditures here do not include the infrastructure needed to generate the 
renewable electricity consumed in the generation of hydrogen required for ammonia, 
or the capital needed to extract natural gas and transport it to a terminal. However, 
in the case of renewable electricity, the assessment does include some upstream 
investments such as for the electrolyzers and liquefaction plant necessary to turn 
electrical energy into zero-carbon hydrogen. In the case of natural gas, it includes 
the steam methane reformation and CCS plant necessary to generate zero-carbon 
hydrogen via this alternative route. Furthermore, the capital expenditures also 
include the marginal cost of either building new or retrofitting existing vessels to run 
on the various fuel types used on the decarbonization pathway outcomes from the 
model. These vessel costs include the costs of any efficiency technologies selected 
by the techno-economic model used in UMAS (2020).
Based on the scope of the assessment outlined above and in the report Aggregate 
investment for the decarbonization of the shipping industry (UMAS 2020), the scale of 
cumulative investments needed between 2030 and 2050 to achieve decarbonization 
by 2070 is approximately $1.0 to $1.4 trillion. When fully decarbonizing shipping 
by 2050, additional investments of approximately $400 to $500 billion would be 
required over 20 years, increasing the total investment needed to $1.4 to $1.9 trillion.
In this assessment, the time value of money has been ignored and the capital 
expenditures have simply been summed across the two decades to provide a 
magnitude estimate of the capital needed and present the scale of that capital. 
This is because this quantification has not been intended for comparative purposes. 
In return, all the underlying modelling to estimate the technology and fuel choices 
made at discrete points in time do include representation of the time value of money 
using a discount rate of 10 percent (see Appendix A).
The investments required depend mainly on the production method for the zero-
carbon hydrogen needed to produce ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Figure 11 
shows the total investment in infrastructure required for the three different methods 
of hydrogen production. These methods include electrolysis production, production 
based on steam methane reformation with CCS, and a mix of the two.

expenditures. The overall breakdown of the investment needs for the LNG uptake

Figure 11 and Figure 12 show that the scale of investment needed to decarbonize 
the shipping sector is significant and that most of this investment is tied to producing 
zero-carbon ammonia and hydrogen.
4.2.2	 Investments required for the use of LNG as a temporary 
fuel
How much additional investment would be needed to deploy the corresponding 
infrastructure and fleet if LNG served as temporary fuel at large scale?
In the LNG uptake “Near-term substitution” case, a significant use of LNG as a bunker 
fuel is forced into the shipping fleet from 2021 onwards as described in sub-section 
4.1. This leads to additional capital expenditures relative to the baseline case, which 
does not find any significant uptake of LNG. The evolution of the assumed maritime 
fleet is identical to the one used to assess the GHG implications in sub-section 4.1. 
In the LNG uptake “Near-term substitution” case, a two-stage conversion can be 
observed: first from oil-derived bunker fuels to LNG, followed by LNG to zero-
carbon bunker fuels. Due to the technical challenges associated with retrofitting 
LNG technology to existing vessels powered by heavy fuel oil (HFO), it is assumed 
that all newbuilds from 2021 will be LNG-powered vessels and the existing oil-
powered fleet remains in service until the end of its economic life. Again, from the 
2030s, under the modelled constraint of a gradually reducing level of absolute CO2 
emissions (see Appendix A), from the 2030s onwards the fleet then transitions to a 
zero-carbon fleet comprised of ammonia-powered vessels to fulfill the targets of 
the two decarbonization scenarios. As in the “Baseline” case, the final zero-carbon 
transition is achieved through a mix of ammonia newbuilds and retrofits (this time 
mostly from LNG to ammonia given the prevalence of LNG as a bunker fuel by 2030 
rather than from HFO/LSHFO to ammonia as in the “Baseline” case).

The resulting fuel mix in the LNG uptake “Near-term substitution” case is provided 
in Figure 13. Under the two scenarios of full decarbonization by 2050 and by 2070, 
this case based on Future 2, “Temporary role for LNG,” shows a rapid increase in 
LNG use between 2021 and 2031.
Under the “Full decarbonization by 2070” scenario, LNG’s share in the bunker fuel 
mix rises to approximately 40 percent by 2031, before declining from 2031 as the 
bunker fuel mix shifts rapidly toward ammonia (see Appendix A). This increase in LNG 
market share is greater than the upper bound scenarios examined in the literature 
review in section 2 (the highest share projected was 21 percent), but provides a 
useful test case for comparison with the LNG “Baseline” uptake.
Under the “Full decarbonization by 2050” scenario, about 47 percent of the fleet (in 
terms of number of ships) use LNG as a temporary fuel in 2031. This value is driven 
by the assumption that every newbuild from 2021 uses LNG as a bunker fuel, and 
is influenced both by the average lifetime (total time at sea) of an individual ship, 
as well as the rate of demand growth and growth in fleet size. By 2036, the share 
of the total fleet using LNG as a bunker fuel drops to 22 percent due to the rapid 
retrofitting of LNG ships to ammonia. This retrofitting is driven by the need to achieve 
the rate of CO2 reduction specified for the decarbonization scenario (Appendix A). 
Retrofitting becomes necessary as the required CO2 reduction cannot be achieved 
through the combination of zero-carbon newbuilds and energy efficiency alone. 
This also makes it necessary to switch from fossil fuels to zero-carbon bunker fuels 
in the existing fleet.
Once such a policy driver for ammonia is in place, it will be primarily the younger 
fleet that will experience retrofits since newer ships have a longer period for return 
on investment. Less retrofitting is expected for the vessels that are 15 or more years 
old, where a retrofit return would need to be shorter and appears less financially 
compelling. These dynamics reveal a potential investment risk for the land-side 
LNG infrastructure, since the declining LNG throughput may become insufficient to 
service the long-term debt payments under such a sharp market contraction.

This analysis of the fleet composition over time provides two important insights:
	

Risk for the LNG fleet: The introduced LNG vessel fleet may almost immediately 
be retrofitted to ammonia to meet the IMO’s decarbonization target of at least a 
50 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. In many instances, this could 
be within the first dry-dock period. This is likely to challenge the economics of 
these vessels, with many owners opting to hold older vessels and switch directly 
from an oil-derived fuel to a zero-carbon fuel in a single-stage conversion (as 
suggested by UMAS 2020).
	

Risk for the LNG infrastructure: There is also a risk that any corresponding LNG 
infrastructure becomes underutilized from 2036 onwards. The market turnover 
rate limiting the rate at which LNG vessels can naturally enter the maritime fleet, 
coupled with the imperative of the zero-carbon transition, may result in less 
than 10 years of significant LNG demand from shipping. This presents a financial 
risk for any investors in related infrastructure.

The additional investment costs of the LNG uptake “Near-term substitution” case 
have been calculated by subtracting the total costs of the LNG uptake “Baseline” 
case. This step allows examination of the aggregate investment implications of a 
two-stage conversion (oil to LNG, followed by LNG to zero-carbon) relative to a 
single-stage conversion from the current oil-derived bunker fuels directly to zero-
carbon bunker fuels. This process is repeated for both decarbonization scenarios: 
full decarbonization by 2050 and full decarbonization by 2070. The additional 
investment costs include:
	

Additional capital investment in an LNG-compatible fleet (for example, the 
marginal LNG-related costs relative to a standard oil-powered vessel)
	

Additional capital investment in land infrastructure (for example, additional 
bunkering infrastructure and LNG delivery barges)
The capital expenditure assumptions used for onboard equipment (in the maritime 
fleet) and the capital expenditure assumptions used for LNG supply chain (land-
based infrastructure) are provided in Appendix C. For the LNG supply pathways, only 
the midstream capital expenditures are included. This is based on the assumption 
that wherever LNG will be bunkered, there will be an LNG exporting or importing 
terminal nearby with sufficient capacity to serve shipping. This assumption is backed 
by the maturity of existing global LNG infrastructure, which is currently used to trade 
LNG as a commodity in the broader energy system (especially in North America, 
Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia). However, in certain geographies 
where this synergy may not yet necessarily exist (for example, Africa), a bespoke 
LNG terminal or a liquefaction plant may be needed to enable the supply of LNG as 
a bunker fuel. Consequently, the capital expenditure for the supply pathway would 
further increase, and the current cost assumptions would be rather optimistic.
Table 6 displays the additional capital expenditures associated with LNG-powered 
vessels and land-based infrastructure for LNG. For each of the decarbonization 
scenarios shown in Table 6—decarbonization by 2050 (left); decarbonization by 
2070 (right)—the following Figure 14 illustrates the growth of LNG demand alongside 
annual and cumulative total land-related capital expenditures. This figure, combined 
with Table 6, shows that a significant but temporary shift to LNG adds at least a 
further 10-17 percent to the total investment needed on top of the basic $1.0 to 
$1.9 trillion to decarbonize shipping. As stated previously, the capital expenditure 
premiums relate to the marginal infrastructure and vessel investments needed to 
deliver the decarbonization scenarios. 
Figure 14 has a small increase in capital expenditures (and therefore cumultative 
capital expenditures) in 2051. This is because the lifetime of some of the assets is 
estimated as 20 years, and by 2051 the earlier investments would need replacing/
updating. Whilst the modelling estimates this late need for new capital expenditures 
due to the assumptions used and the continued (albeit falling) demand, in practice 
with these demand profiles this may not occur and could constitute a small constraint 
on supply volumes of LNG by 2051. Further capital will be required throughout 
the period for any non-fuel/energy-related investment needs over this period (for 
 46
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
example, refinancing of fleet, financing other retrofits and maintenance, financing 
new-build tonnage, and financing port and cargo capacity).
As these additional investments will primarily relate to the fleet- and land-based 
infrastructure enhancements before the large-scale investments in zero-carbon 
bunker fuels begin around 2030, the annual investments for LNG will be high in 
the period 2021 to 2031, but then rapidly decrease. There is little difference in the 
total additional investment between decarbonization by 2050 and by 2070. This 
is because the difference between these scenarios is primarily in the speed of the 
shift to ammonia in the period 2031 to 2051, and there appears to be little difference 
between the scenarios in the preceding years.

By combining the modelling outcomes of sub-sections 4.1 and 4.2, it can be estimated 
that a “temporary” though significant use of LNG by the international maritime fleet 
is likely to lead to moderate-to-negative GHG benefits and an additional capital 
cost of at least 10–17 percent compared to a “baseline” case with a limited role for 
LNG. It would likely require an additional capital investment of between $169 billion 
and $186 billion. When these capital flows are discounted to their present value 
in 2020, the nearer term capital expenditures on LNG become more significant 
relative to the longer term (and therefore more discounted) capital expenditures on 
ammonia. With a discount rate of 10 percent, the estimate of the additional capital 
investments associated with a “temporary” use of LNG becomes $98 billion and 
$82 billion for decarbonization by 2050 and 2070, respectively. As proportions of 
the discounted total additional capital expenditures for achieving decarbonization, 
these discounted values then both represent over 30 percent of additional capital 
expenditures required to achieve full decarbonization.
This financial amount is provided as an indicative value to demonstrate the scale 
of the additional capital and costs required if LNG was to play a temporary role 
in shipping’s decarbonization. It should be understood as the upper bound of the 
capital that is at risk of premature write-down as demand for LNG falls off from the 
2030s onwards. It is an upper bound value since much of this capital may have 
already generated a return as it progressed through some of its economic life 
before the write-down starts. The exact amount at risk depends on how the market 
foresees the decarbonization scenarios described here, the actual paybacks set, 
and how (and whether) any demand contraction for LNG materializes in practice. 
However, given the magnitude of the upper bound of capital at risk, this suggests 
that any financial risks would benefit from being carefully assessed for robustness 
to a contraction in demand for LNG as a bunker fuel. Therefore, it appears important 
to understand the financial viability of potential LNG vessels and infrastructure, and 
the risk of them becoming stranded assets.13

Stranded assets are defined as assets that have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, 
devaluations or conversion to liabilities” (Caldecott, Tilbury, and Carey 2014).
 48
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
 4.3	 RISK OF STRANDED ASSETS
What may be the potential risk of stranded assets associated with LNG as a temporary 
fuel?
The “Near-term substitution” case (Future 2: “Temporary role for LNG”) estimates 
declining LNG demand from its peak in 2030 (as shown in Figure 15). This means 
that the infrastructure built in the 2020s, sized for this peak, will continue serving 
the LNG demand out to 2050. The potential utilization rate of such infrastructure 
would inevitably fall as LNG demand wanes. Utilization improves once again in the 
late 2040s as the infrastructure built in the 2020s retires and can be replaced with 
much smaller-scale assets to serve the remaining legacy demand. This rapid drop 
in demand and in the related utilization rate of existing LNG infrastructure may lead 
to concerns about the financial viability of the LNG infrastructure.
The modelling assumes that, during the 2020s, large-scale and long-life LNG 
infrastructure will be installed as investors expect the traditional (approximately) 20 
years payback period. As the growth in demand for LNG slows in the mid-2020s 
and the actual demand starts to decrease after 2031, it is assumed that the LNG 
supply chain infrastructure will be replaced with smaller-scale and shorter-life 
infrastructure.
The level of risk of stranded assets in the LNG uptake “Near-term substitution” case 
is particularly sensitive to the level of demand foresight in the LNG supply market. 
Good foresight allows better decisions to be made around the intended economic 
size and lifetime of any LNG infrastructure investments, and the options to manage 
the period of declining demand. For example, the likelihood of an asset becoming 
stranded could be reduced through the use of smaller-scale and shorter-life LNG 
infrastructure targeted at enhanced flexibility in phasing out supply as demand falls. 
This could also be done by extending the life of the older large-scale assets beyond 
20 years, as demand falls, to avoid the need for newbuild LNG assets in the 2040s.
From a financial perspective, capital expenditures may be paid off before these 
stranded asset risks materialize and before the end of the economic life of the LNG 
asset. Yet in this instance the asset owner may still face a residual value risk with a 
lower price than expected if the asset is then to be sold on the second-hand market. 
Furthermore, the asset owner may also risk other forms of write-down in asset value, 
for example due to new regulation or strengthening negative perception of methane 
emissions, which may influence the need for a costly retrofit to control methane 
emissions, or a reduced asset life.

Due to the rapid drop in demand and therefore utilization rates around the middle of 
the 2030s, there may be a serious risk of stranded assets within the LNG supply chain 
for shipping. This could possibly create a degree of political pressure countering 
decarbonization incentives as investors seek to minimize potential losses. If this 
political pressure results in a delay of the decarbonization pathway, this outcome 
could further exacerbate the GHG emissions risk, threatening IMO’s 2050 climate 
target. Such market inertial effects are termed as “technology pathway lock-ins,” or, 
in this specific case, as “LNG lock-in.” The next sub-section of this report attempts 
to quantify the amount of additional GHG emissions that could result from various 
scenarios of a fossil LNG lock-in.
 4.4	 RISK OF A TECHNOLOGY LOCK-IN
What could be the consequences of a fossil-derived LNG technology pathway “lock-
in”?
A major environmental concern associated with a significant temporary deployment 
of LNG is the potential risk for a GHG emissions “lock-in.” As can be seen from sub-
section 2.2.1, this would be at odds with IMO’s GHG emissions reduction target for 
2050. This sub-section quantifies the GHG impact of a potential fossil LNG lock-
in using the fleet composition underlying the “Near-term substitution” case as a 
starting point.
Building upon the cases explored in the previous sub-sections (“Baseline” and 
“Near-term substitution”), two additional lock-in cases are analyzed. The starting 
point is the “Near-term substitution” case (based on Future 2: “Temporary role 
for LNG”) that delivers full decarbonization by 2070 and meets the IMO’s GHG 
emissions reduction target of at least 50 percent by 2050. These two new cases 
 50
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
are labelled LNG uptake “Long term lock-in 25 percent” and “Long term lock-in 50 
percent.” These lock-in suppositions refer to a situation where the LNG-powered 
maritime fleet is maintained just to service the infrastructure debt, despite the 
IMO’s decarbonization 2050 target. “Long term lock-in 25 percent” assumes that 
25 percent of the ammonia demand present in the relevant LNG uptake “Near-
term substitution” case will be displaced by LNG. Similarly, “Long term lock-in 50 
percent” assumes that 50 percent of the ammonia demand is offset by continous 
demand for LNG. The resulting fuel mixes are provided in Figure 16.
FIGURE 16: EXPECTED FUEL MIX FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING UNDER TWO CASES (“LOCK-IN 
25 PERCENT” AND “LOCK-IN 50 PERCENT”)
Both based on Future 2 (“Temporary role for LNG”) and one decarbonization scenario by 2070
The assumed bunker fuel mixes lead to several GHG emissions trajectories. Figure 
17 shows a comparison between both the lock-in cases and the two prior cases, 
“Baseline” and “Near-term substitution,” using mid-methane emissions (an average 
of the identified high and low bounds for methane leakage, see Appendix B ). The 
comparison is shown only for the full decarbonization by 2070 scenario. Under 
the mid-methane emissions assumptions, as can also be shown for the case 
with low methane assumptions in Figure 9 (on page 37), the three cases that all 
have significant uptake of LNG by 2031 result in a small reduction in peak CO2eq 
emissions relative to the baseline case.

In the lock-in cases, the cumulative operational (downstream only) CO2eq emissions 
increase by 5 to 14 percent relative to the non-lock-in cases. In absolute terms, 
this means that if the use of LNG continued—ignoring any climate policy such as a 
stringent carbon price on bunker fuels that would force the international maritime 
fleet to comply with the IMO’s decarbonisation 2050 target—this would result in 
approximately 1,300 and 3,500 million tons, respectively, of additional cumulative 
GHG emissions up to 2051. Such excess emissions represent 1.5 to 4 years of 
current annual GHG emissions from ships and would further call into question 
shipping’s GHG emissions-reductions trajectory consistent with the Paris Agreement 
temperature goals.

LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
 4.5	  LESSONS LEARNED
This section provides a scenario analysis of the potential use of LNG as a temporary 
bunker fuel in shipping’s decarbonization. The analysis suggests that the direction 
and magnitude of the effect of a temporary use of LNG on GHG emissions is 
uncertain, ranging from a moderate decrease to an equivalent moderate increase. 
In contrast, a significant uptake of LNG would require substantial additional capital 
expenditures, and these investments may be challenged by the market evolution. 
Overall, this analysis suggests that the use of LNG as a transitory fuel is likely to 
face challenges in terms of environmental and financial risks.

5.	 CONCLUSIONS AND 
OUTLOOK
5.1	 CONCLUSIONS
At the start of this report the following questions were posed: What would the 
role of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a bunker fuel in the years 2020–2050 look 
like? Offering significant air quality benefits, could LNG also make an important 
contribution to the targets set by Initial International Maritime Organization (IMO) 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Strategy and the sector’s transition toward low- and zero-
carbon shipping?
The conclusions of this report have been developed through a logic that starts 
with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals, considers shipping’s GHG emissions 
trajectory and the associated fuel mix that would be required to meet those 
goals, and assumes that appropriate policy would be introduced to achieve those 
outcomes. The Initial IMO GHG Strategy is consistent with this logic. Within this 
context, there is consensus across the literature and industry that LNG cannot form 
a large proportion of the bunker fuel mix in 2050 due to its carbon intensity (ICS 
2018, IMO 2018a, GMF 2018).
This means that three main possibilities for the role of LNG as a bunker fuel can be 
imagined: 
1.	 Future 1: A transitional role for LNG – “Use and reuse.”
2.	 Future 2: A temporary role for LNG – “Use and then stop.”
3.	 Future 3: A limited role for LNG – “Limited use overall.”
 54
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
Analyzing these possibilities has helped to answer the questions posed above. In 
general, the literature review in section 2 shows that the short-term environmental, 
macroeconomic, technological, and regulatory drivers for the uptake of LNG at large 
scale (greater than 10 percent of fuel mix in energy terms) appear relatively weak. 
The main policy driver affecting the industry in the timeframe 2020 to 2050 is likely 
to be the Initial IMO GHG Strategy. As discussed above, the Strategy, however, 
does not represent a driver for a significant uptake of LNG either. No other major 
commercial driver or regulatory mechanism could be identified to drive the large-
scale uptake of LNG in the period before the shift to zero-carbon bunker fuels in the 
2030s.
The compatibility as well as viability discussions in section 3 discount the possibility of 
Future 1 (“Transitional Role for LNG”). The future zero-carbon bunker fuels compatible 
with LNG infrastructure, liquefied biomethane (LBM) and liquefied synthetic methane 
(LSM), are not likely to be available and competitively priced at the volumes needed 
to meet shipping’s total energy demand by 2050. It also appears likely that there 
will be much more scalable and cost-effective zero-carbon alternatives, such as 
ammonia and hydrogen (Volume 1: The Potential of Zero-Carbon Bunker Fuels 
in Developing Countries, see Preamble). This does not rule out that some LBM 
and LSM may be available, most likely at a price premium relative to the fuel that 
becomes the mainstream zero-carbon alternative. That LBM and LSM supply could 
be harnessed for those existing LNG assets for which a business case can be made 
despite the price premium. Yet there are substantial caveats to the prospects of 
methane variants like LBM and LSM to serve as fallback options for LNG assets 
that would otherwise become stranded. These caveats, in return, do not support 
the argument that LNG is likely to play a significant transitional role in shipping’s 
decarbonization.
Section 4 provides further data suggesting the likely limited role for LNG in the 
decarbonization of shipping. It compares the implications of an idealized Future 
2 (“Temporary role for LNG”) based on a potential temporary role for LNG, with 
Future 3 (“A limited role for LNG”), which foresees a rather limited role for LNG. The 
analysis shows that if there were a very strong commercial or regulatory driver for 
LNG, then this could provide a variety of potential outcomes. These outcomes range 
from moderate, but not transformative, GHG benefits to moderate GHG disbenefits 
depending on the assumptions found in the literature. The maximum GHG benefit 
would be eight percent lower GHG emissions in 2030, while the maximum disbenefit 
would be nine percent higher GHG emissions in the same year.
The analysis in section 4 also examines the aggregate investment implications 
of a two-stage conversion (oil to LNG, followed by LNG to zero-carbon) relative 
to a single-stage conversion from the current oil-derived bunker fuels directly to 
zero-carbon bunker fuels. A single-stage conversion would imply a limited role 
for LNG. The capital expenditure for Future 2 (“Temporary role for LNG”) ranges at 
least between 110 to 117 percent of the capital expenditure needed to implement 
Future 3 (“A limited role for LNG”). This may amount to up to $186 billion of additional 
capital expenditure. The temporary use of LNG therefore results in a range of GHG 
 VOLUME 2: ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
55
outcomes from moderately better to moderately worse alongside considerable 
additional capital expenditure relative to the counterfactual without a significant 
role for LNG.
Section 4 also considers the utilization rates of the relatively short-lived LNG assets. 
This analysis shows that, even if the additional capital of up to $186 billion could be 
raised, it would likely face financial risks due to the steep decline in LNG demand 
from the mid-2030s onwards. One consequence of these financial risks could be 
commercial and ultimately political pressure to ensure a more gradual phase-out 
and decline in demand for LNG as a bunker fuel. However, this would, in turn, create 
an environmental risk in the form of technology lock-in and important increases in 
cumulative GHG emissions from ships.
This analysis does not exclude the possibility that some jurisdictions may have 
a strong domestic interest to make significant short-term investments in LNG, for 
instance, to achieve the obvious air quality benefits of LNG over traditional heavy fuel 
oil (HFO)-powered vessels. This is particularly true of particulate matter emissions, 
which remain difficult to abate when using low sulfur heavy fuel oil (LSHFO) or 
marine diesel oil, even if the currently available emission-reduction technologies 
are fully applied (Lehtoranta et al. 2019). In such cases where LNG is adopted, the 
supply and use of LNG should be monitored to show control of methane emissions, 
thus ensuring a meaningful GHG benefit relative to conventional oil-derived fuels.
However, these situations may not necessarily materialize since, depending on the 
technology used onboard, the same air quality benefits could be achieved by zero-
carbon bunker fuels, too. Burning hydrogen does not emit anything but water vapor 
anyway. Yet, while not emitting any sulfur oxides (SOx) or carbon dioxide (CO2), the 
combustion of ammonia leads to nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (a 
potent GHG and ozone depleting substance commonly known as laughing gas) 
emissions. However, these can be abated through existing technologies such as 
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) which are commercially available today. The 
related costs and the resulting exhaust levels of NOx and N2O are comparable 
to the current use of SCR with fossil fuels (Alfa Laval et al. 2020). Consequently, 
there are advantages to addressing both air pollution and GHG emissions with a 
single solution, especially as the timescale required for rapidly deploying zero-
carbon bunker fuels (from 2030 to achieve the least ambitious interpretation of the 
Initial IMO GHG Strategy targets, until 2050) is short. In any case, at present, these 
potential special cases where short-term investments in LNG could be warranted 
are not expected to create significant global demand for LNG as a bunker fuel.
By discounting Future 1 (“Transitional role for LNG”) and Future 2 (“Temporary role 
for LNG”), the report concludes that Future 3 (“A limited role for LNG”) appears to be 
the most likely possibility that still meets the IMO’s climate target.
Still, there may be niche circumstances outside of this report’s global whole-sector 
perspective which may allow for decisions contrary to the general conclusions here. 
Niche applications for LNG may exist where specific circumstances speak in favor 
of LNG and against alternative options. These niche circumstances can deviate 
 56
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
significantly from the whole-sector assumptions applied in this report. It is therefore 
possible that for individual cases, industry stakeholders may be able to make 
investments on a timescale, or in such a manner, that they can crystallize benefits 
(for example, reduced air pollutant emissions) and effectively mitigate major risks 
related to LNG. These risks include a rapid demand reduction for LNG after 2030, 
or any regulation that more clearly calls into question the commercial viability of 
shipping’s LNG assets in the long term.
Such niche circumstances are mostly related to short-term advantages. Examples 
of short-term advantages may exist on privileged routes that already benefit from 
existing LNG terminals and favorable LNG bunker pricing and availability at either 
port, for specific vessel types such as LNG carriers, ferries, cruise ships, or coastal 
vessels, or in special circumstances when there are strong domestic interests 
favoring LNG. For instance, a liner ship may be designed to be operated on a 
route with existing favorable access to LNG supply at prices which are expected 
to remain competitive relative to oil-derived fuels for the entire duration of the 
2020s and at a spread to oil-derived bunker fuels which enables the LNG capital 
expenditure premium to be paid off well in advance of any need for a retrofit to zero-
carbon fuel. In a second example, a ferry, cruise ship, or coastal vessel may spend 
significant time in operation away from port (and therefore out of access to cold 
ironing or shore power), but still near centers of population. It may therefore reap a 
disproportionately higher benefit from the reduced air pollutant emissions of LNG.
Additionally, niche circumstances may also result from anticipated restricted 
access to zero-carbon bunker fuel options on a ship’s pre-existing route, relative to 
global average availabilities of such fuels. Yet this may still mean that the identified 
challenges to LNG’s long-term competitiveness are likely to be reflected in the 
second-hand pricing of these assets toward the end of this decade.
Based upon this conclusion, Table 7 provides the answers to the key questions 
posed at the beginning of this report.

57
TABLE 7: REPORT KEY QUESTIONS AND CORRESPONDING ANSWERS
QUESTION
ANSWER
What would the role of LNG as a 
bunker fuel in the years 2020–
2050 look like?
LNG is likely to play a rather limited role as a bunker fuel. Its share of the fuel market 
is likely to grow during the 2020s. By 2030, it may account for up to ten percent of the 
bunker fuel market in energy terms, or up to a maximum of 40 percent if every newbuild 
was to become LNG fueled during this decade. Beyond 2030, the demand for LNG as a 
bunker fuel is expected to decline, with the speed of decline being uncertain and highly 
dependent on future climate policy and zero-carbon fuel market developments. Demand 
for LNG as a bunker fuel may end by the early 2040s, or potentially as late as the early 
2050s (according to the least ambitious interpretation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy). A 
portion of the fleet that is fueled by LNG by 2031 may subsequently move to using LBM or 
LSM. Alternatively, it may be more competitive for these vessels to be retrofitted to the fuel 
type that becomes the dominant zero-carbon bunker fuel, which is currently most likely to 
be ammonia or hydrogen.
Offering significant air quality 
benefits, could LNG also make 
an important contribution to the 
Initial IMO GHG Strategy targets 
and the sector’s transition toward 
low-and zero-carbon shipping?
While air quality benefits from the use of LNG are instant, tangible, and valuable, its use 
should be limited to those circumstances where no preferable alternatives are available, 
and the GHG and financial risks are acknowledged and mitigated. These restrictions are 
likely to prevent LNG from becoming a large-scale bunker fuel in line with IMO’s climate 
target for 2050.

5.2.1	 Implications for policymakers
As outlined by the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, the shipping industry has firmly 
committed to reduce and eliminate GHG emissions from ships in line with achieving 
the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals. In light of this Paris-aligned GHG emissions 
reduction trajectory, the uncertainties surrounding the GHG benefits of LNG suggest 
that new public policy support for LNG as a bunker fuel should be avoided. This 
relates, for example, to policy that provides a regulatory advantage to LNG over 
oil-derived alternatives in shipping. Furthermore, the same reasoning also suggests 
that existing policy support for LNG as a bunker fuel should be curtailed. In this 
regard, the sector’s current Energy Efficiency Design Index, for instance, exclusively 
focuses on downstream CO2 emissions (that is, due to combustion on board), thereby 
disregarding any upstream or midstream CO2 emissions (that is, due to extraction 
and distribution, respectively) or any non-CO2 GHG emissions such as methane.
The report highlights the need for urgent and strong policy action to regulate 
methane emissions both in the supply chain of LNG and in its use on board existing 
ships and any newbuilds. This will be important regardless of whether LNG becomes 
a significant bunker fuel or not. For example, although downstream methane 
emissions could be reduced using newer machinery with lower methane slip levels, 
this would still not address the risk of upstream and midstream methane emissions 
in the supply chain. These present a much more complex problem that is not strictly 
technological in nature, but would require regulatory changes and enforcement 
across the numerous jurisdictions where LNG is extracted and distributed. Many of 
these jurisdictions suffer from generally low regulatory enforcement levels (World 
Justice Project 2020). However, the increasing public scrutiny questioning the 
true lifecycle GHG emissions of any fuel used in a decarbonizing world is likely to 
incentivize such enhanced regulation, too.
Regulating methane is also important to ensure that shipping’s existing LNG assets 
and any that may be built because of commerciaI-case justification in the short 
term are effectively shielded from the risk of increased lifecycle GHG emissions 
relative to conventional oil-derived bunker fuels, and are enabled to maximize their 
potential social benefits (for air quality in particular). The need for stringent policy 
to avoid this risk becomes even more important if the actual energy transition in 
shipping from fossil bunker fuels to zero-carbon bunker fuels were to happen more 
slowly than anticipated in this report.
The report also presents a strong recommendation to focus public support on the 
development of policy that effectively accelerates the research, development, and 
deployment of zero-carbon bunker fuels. Such policies would send another clear 
signal with respect to LNG’s future role, and help mitigate the risks associated with 
a significant future uptake of LNG.
Finally, the parallel analysis of zero-carbon bunker fuels finds that the most 
promising candidate options will require zero-carbon hydrogen as a feedstock 
(Volume 1, see Preamble). There are two major production pathways for producing 
such hydrogen: the first one uses electrolysis powered by 100 percent non-biogenic 
renewable electricity to produce “green” hydrogen; the second involves using 
 60
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
natural gas in conjunction with nearly 100 percent carbon capture and storage to 
produce “blue" hydrogen. Therefore, in contrast to LNG’s direct use as a bunker fuel 
for propulsion purposes, it is quite possible that natural gas could play an important 
role in shipping’s decarbonization as a feedstock for the production of zero-carbon 
bunker fuels such as blue hydrogen, as illustrated in Figure 18. More information on 
zero-carbon bunker fuels in general, and blue hydrogen specifically, can be found 
in the related Volume 1 (see Preamble).
Policies to support zero-carbon bunker fuels as mentioned above are advantageous 
because these are long-term solutions that can solve both the GHG and air pollution 
reduction challenges faced by shipping. As always, any policy that can provide 
regulatory clarity and consistency will help industry to make more certain long-term 
decisions about shipping’s decarbonization.
5.2.2	 Implications for industry
Shipping’s decarbonization is not driven by public policy alone. It is also driven by 
owners, fuel suppliers, financiers, and shareholders managing their own exposure 
to climate-related investment risks, and by clients and consumers looking to 
decarbonize their wider scopes of emissions. Making overt decisions contrary to 
the logical pathway for shipping’s decarbonization can therefore pose risks both 
to compliance with more and more stringent policies implemented in line with the 
Paris Agreement’s temperature goals, but also in terms of future access to financial 
capital and market share.
The analysis in this report concludes that LNG is likely to have a limited role as 
a bunker fuel, with any demand for LNG rapidly declining after 2030. Therefore, 
to minimize the potential loss of returns, industry stakeholders should consider 
LNG's questionable long-term competitiveness as a bunker fuel when developing 
their future business strategies. Furthermore, in light of a world with more and more 
commitments by public and private players to net zero GHG emissions by mid-
century, industry stakeholders should also take into consideration the evolving 
climate policy landscape and the rising societal pressure in and outside the shipping 
sector when counting on a significant uptake of LNG as a bunker fuel. Niche-market 
investments in LNG are likely to face increasing headwinds through the course of 
the 2020s in such a context.
The current uncertainty within the industry, which does not know for certain yet 
which specific future zero-carbon bunker fuels to invest in, is understandable. 
The resulting hesitance in terms of investment decisions is reflected in the current 
orderbooks for new vessels, where global orders have recently been at the lowest 
level observed since 1989 (Clarksons Research 2020). While major businesses 
are already announcing their favored zero-carbon shipping solutions, all industry 
stakeholders—especially the ones with a lower risk appetite—are well advised to 
opt for the following: investing in increased energy efficiency and remaining flexible 
on other investments’ compatibility with multiple zero-carbon candidate bunker 
fuels. Investments in increased energy efficiency represent “no-regret” investments 
which will benefit any kind of future bunker fuels. Flexibility in ship design will allow 
 VOLUME 2: ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
61
using oil-derived bunker fuels up to the moment when the fuel supply can be more 
confidently switched to zero-carbon bunker fuels. This flexibility can be achieved, 
for instance, through installing fuel storage and fuel handling equipment that will be 
compatible with a maximum number of emerging zero-carbon bunker fuels—most 
likely ammonia and hydrogen (Volume 1, see Preamble).
Just as for policy makers, all these current decisions faced by industry will be easier 
to resolve when there is greater certainty on the availability, prices, and timing of 
non-oil-derived bunker fuels. Working toward increased clarity through constructive 
support of the policy development processes, and through multi-stakeholder 
collaborations, remains vital.
 5.3	 METHODOLOGICAL OUTLOOK
There are currently close to 200 LNG-fueled ships operating in the world. This relates 
to a global LNG bunker fuel market of 500 kilo ton (kt) in 2019. In the near-term, this 
market is expected to grow to 3,500 kt of LNG by 2023 (MSI 2019). Although this 
growth appears significant, it remains marginal compared to the overall bunkering 
market. LNG will take a maximum fuel market share of three percent in 2023. 
Indeed, this figure represents an optimistic scenario where all LNG-ready ships will 
ultimately run on LNG (MSI 2019). Port authorities are increasingly investing in LNG 
bunkering infrastructure. In particular, EU policy requires at least one LNG bunkering 
port in each member state; several ports are under development in North America; 
and China is expected to be able to service the LNG demand of all vessel types.
Other bunkering infrastructure includes truck loading, bunkering vessel loading, 
local storage, tank-to-ship, and other uses. 
Key areas of uncertainty are still present in the forecast order book of new LNG-
fueled vessels. The outcome of any LNG uptake modelling is particularly sensitive 
to both the forecasts of physical LNG availability, and the LNG price relative to both 
conventional oil-derived fuels and future zero-carbon fuels. 
Further analysis can help to reduce the uncertainties in this initial technical report. 
Input assumptions on costs and prices, as well as performance of the technologies, 
can all be iterated and refined. The fleet and routes can also be modelled in greater 
granularity. This may be particularly important for the smaller ship types that make 
up many of the domestic fleets in operation globally. It is not currently anticipated, 
however, that any of these refinements would substantially affect the conclusions 
drawn in this report. Nevertheless, they may help clarify some of the niche roles for 
LNG as a bunker fuel. It should be noted that improving the granularity of this work 
is important when conducting a future development analysis for a particular country 
or region. Such an analysis is recommended as part of any future work.
Extensive further analysis could be undertaken in particular around the sensitivity 
to the results in this report and the commercial implications highlighted. A key 
 62
LNG’S POTENTIAL AS A TEMPORARY FUEL
assumption in this report has been that as the zero-carbon energy and fuel 
sources become prevalent, the main mechanism of change for the existing fleet 
will be to retrofit a vessel, which creates a need for additional capital requirements. 
However, it may be the case that many fossil-fueled ships (including LNG-fueled 
ships) will instead be prematurely scrapped, with financial consequences to the 
capital provider and asset owner. Should this occur, a more detailed analysis of 
the shipping market dynamics would be required than that included here. Such an 
analysis would enable a more precise understanding of the risk of asset stranding 
than has been possible in this report.
As stated in the conclusions, this report suggests that LNG is unlikely to achieve 
a significant market share (greater than 10 percent by energy) of the bunker fuel 
market. The potential implications of this conclusion on the economic growth of 
the developing world have not been considered. Such a development analysis is 
outside the scope of this report, but it is recommended that such an analysis be 
included in any future work program on this topic. This proposed analysis needs 
to consider the implication of lower on-vessel LNG consumption in the near term 
(to 2040) balanced against the potential upsides that come from the production, 
distribution, and use of zero-carbon fuels like hydrogen and ammonia. World Bank 
(2021) outlines a method for the identification and assessment of key production 
locations and assesses four developing nation locations as examples. It is of note 
that many of the fuel-production methods analyzed within this work utilize natural 
gas combined with CCS to create a range of zero-carbon energy carriers. This 
would allow for the use of natural gas reserves by developing nations where an 
economically viable geological carbon storage site is available.

63
APPENDIX A – MAIN 
ASSUMPTIONS AND 
CREDENTIALS OF GLOTRAM
Section 4 has made use of the Global Transport Model (GloTraM), a techno-economic 
model of the global freight transport system, currently focused on international 
shipping. The details of GloTraM are described in the modelling work of Smith et 
al. (2019), but the guiding assumptions used to derive the three LNG uptake cases 
discussed in section 4 were as follows:
	

Demand for shipping: There is significant growth in demand for shipping, 
consistent with the Third International Maritime Organization (IMO) Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) Study, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
scenario Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 (global average 
temperature increases of approximately two degrees Celsius, and a significant 
shift in demand away from fossil fuel use). This demand scenario is used 
because the modelling work for this report was undertaken before publication 
and availability of the Fourth IMO GHG Study. The more recent study includes 
continued expectations of significant growth in demand for shipping to 2050, 
albeit in relative terms lower estimates than the Third IMO GHG Study. The lower 
estimates relate both to the differences in the gross domestic product scenario 
assumptions used, as well as differences in the modelling method used to 
forecast transport demand (the latter including the use of a new freight transport 
demand forecasting model in the Fourth IMO GHG Study, which estimates 
lower values for the growth rates of future demand). The consequence of these 
lower demand growth scenarios, if all else is equal, is expected to be a modest 
reduction in the volume growth of zero-carbon fuel, albeit no change in the 
general finding that fossil fuel will need to be substantially or fully substituted 
with zero-carbon fuel by 2050.
	

Profit-maximizing decisions: Unless explicitly stated otherwise in this modelling, 
shipowners and investors make profit-maximizing decisions in their selection of 
ship specification and operation, against the backdrop of evolving regulation, 
technology costs, and energy/fuel prices.
	

Discounting: The modelling uses a discount rate of 10 percent in all economic 
calculations.
	

Bioenergy supply: No significant quantity of bioenergy (for example, liquefied 
biomethane) becomes available for use in shipping (due to supply pressures on 
land use and numerous other demand sources).
 APPENDIX A – MAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND CREDENTIALS OF GLOTRAM
64
	

Existing regulations: All existing regulations under the International Convention 
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI (on GHG and air 
pollution) are applied and complied with.
	

Additional policy: An additional policy (in this case the application of a carbon 
price) is used to incentivize absolute GHG emissions reduction. This is used as 
a modelling mechanism to enable the target carbon dioxide (CO2) trajectory. 
The model is solved iteratively with variations in the CO2 price. The CO2 price 
is used as a generic policy lever to stimulate a variable amount of uptake of 
both energy efficiency and alternative fuel options. It is a proxy for a range of 
potential policy option packages that may be applied to regulate international 
shipping by the IMO, but which remain uncertain because they are currently 
under development.
	

Modelled fleet: The modelling is focused on the ships most unambiguously 
associated with international shipping: container ships, oil tankers, bulk carriers, 
ferries, and cruise ships. This fleet accounts for approximately 70 percent of 
the GHG emissions from international shipping as estimated in the Third IMO 
GHG Study. An approximate scaling up of these results can be used to estimate 
their implications for total international shipping and domestic shipping, but this 
would assume that their transition pathways are identical, and that costs and 
GHG emissions scale linearly.
	

System boundaries: The modelling system boundary is on the interface 
between shipping and the energy system. Fuel supply chain capital costs are 
inclusive of all the components bespoke for the production, transport, and 
storage of bunker fuel but not the production of the electricity, oil, or natural gas 
that is used as a feedstock of those bunker fuels. The further upstream (e.g., 
feedstock production) processes are included in the lifecycle GHG emissions 
estimation and their costs are represented through feedstock prices.
The decarbonization scenarios are solved by specifying a limit on the absolute GHG 
emissions applied to each time step from 2026. This limit value is set according to 
a trajectory of constantly reducing all GHG emissions from 2026 onwards, until a 
value is reached in 2050 (either an absolute reduction in downstream/operational 
GHG emissions of 50 percent by 2050, approximately consistent with achieving full 
decarbonization by 2070, or a reduction of 100 percent). This emission trajectory is 
an interpretation of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, which specifies as an ambition a 
“path of CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals.” 
Whilst that statement and the accompanying absolute and relative GHG and carbon 
intensity targets remain ambiguous, a judgment is applied that this implies a peaking 
of absolute emissions in the 2020s followed by a steady decline to the absolute 
2050 target values. In practice, many different trajectories may be conceived by 
the IMO. The judgment is justified as the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals are 
a function of cumulative GHG emissions and not the absolute levels in 2050. This 
means that the GHG emission trajectories to 2050 will need to be monotonically 
reducing from an imminent peaking of emissions, to avoid a significant growth in 
shipping’s overall share of anthropogenic contribution to climate change.
 VOLUME 2: THE ROLE OF LNG IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD LOW- AND ZERO-CARBON SHIPPING
65
The modelling finds a solution for the most cost-effective composition of the fleet 
at each time step using the input options for reducing shipping’s GHG emissions, 
the growth in demand, and the target absolute GHG emissions. The finding that 
zero-carbon bunker fuels are needed from 2030, regardless of whether the total 
fleet reaches zero GHG emissions in 2050 or 2070, is a consequence of all these 
interacting factors. The growth in demand and the constraint on GHG emissions 
drives an increase in energy efficiency relative to the baseline fleet performance 
in 2016. However, that increase in energy efficiency has a diminishing return as 
the most cost-effective options increasingly penetrate the fleet. Under diminishing 
energy efficiency-derived carbon intensity improvements, zero-carbon bunker fuels 
are then needed to achieve absolute reductions in GHG emissions in spite of growing 
demand. The 2030 date estimated for the introduction of zero-carbon bunker fuels 
could be postponed if any one or more of the following conditions arose:
1.	 The demand in growth for shipping is significantly lower than projected. As 
indicated above, the Fourth IMO GHG Study assumes lower demand growth to 
2050, but no significant difference to 2030, which is the demand growth period 
most relevant to the date when zero-carbon bunker fuels enter the fleet.
2.	 There are greater energy efficiency improvements in practice than as estimated 
by this modelling. However, recently agreed new energy efficiency regulation 
at the IMO Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) 75 does not 
include strong enforcement or high stringency and therefore may not produce 
high compliance or significant improvements in efficiency by 2030.
3.	 Instead of a gradual decline in GHG emissions from the 2020s, these continue 
to rise/peak in the 2030s and decline more steeply thereafter (if maintaining 
the same level of cumulative emissions), or if shipping’s share of anthropogenic 
emissions increases and is compensated for by an average greater reduction 
in emissions across all other sectors.
4.	 The Paris Agreement’s temperature goals are not achieved.
GloTraM was originally developed during the years 2010–2013 as part of the United 
Kingdom (UK) government-funded research project “Low Carbon Shipping – A 
Systems Approach.” The model and its supporting evidence base and assumptions 
have received significant UK research funding investment (totaling approximately 
$6 million) since the initial UK government funded project. GloTraM has been used 
for a number of studies (including for submission to the IMO GHG debates, separate 
studies commissioned by the European Commission and the UK government, as 
well as to inform the corporate strategy of several multinationals). It is continuously 
improved and revised, and formed a major component of the evidence base used in 
the debates leading up to the adoption of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy. A key study 
in those debates is IMO ISWG-GHG 1-INF.2 “A scientific study on possible targets 
and their associated pathways” produced using GloTraM (2016).
 APPENDIX B – GHG EMISSIONS FACTORS 
66
APPENDIX B – GHG EMISSIONS 
FACTORS 
To calculate the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions impact at each stage of the 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) lifecycle, GHG emissions factors for both carbon dioxide 
(CO2) and CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) at the up- and midstream stages and at the 
downstream stage (onboard operational stage) have been applied. These factors 
are summarized in Table 8. High and low LNG GHG emissions factors represent 
the degree of uncertainty surrounding methane leakage in the up- and midstream 
processes, as well as the variety of pathways that can be taken. In calculating 
the CO2eq value for each fuel, only methane and nitrous oxides were considered, 
with Global Warming Potentials (GWP) of 25 and 298, respectively (IPCC 2007). As 
stated within the main report, this GWP for methane is more conservative than the 
IPCC’s revised GWP for methane (reference IPCC 2013 that now gives a GWP figure 
of 36 over a 100-year period); however it enables the modelling in this assessment 
to remain consistent with the referenced studies and data sources.

OF LNG ONBOARD 
TECHNOLOGY AND

LNG ONBOARD TECHNOLOGY
Capital expenditure for LNG-compatible internal combustion engines and associated 
storage technology is assumed to be $1.4 million/MW (Smith et al. 2019).
LNG SUPPLY CHAIN
Capital investments for each year were estimated from a baseline per-unit cost using 
information from existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure assets, across the 
up- and midstream components. Unit components were then scaled up by annual 
maritime LNG demand, with an assumed utilization rate of 70 percent. Unit costs for 
each component are scaled to the annual throughput of a large LNG storage tank, 
chosen for its long lifetime and accurate capacity metrics. This utilization rate can be 
lower in years where demand has decreased faster than assets have depreciated, 
which is assumed to occur at the rate of the component with the shortest expected 
lifetime. Table 9 outlines each component and its key operational and financial 
parameters, alongside data sources.

LNG can take multiple routes from the gas well to the vessel fuel tank. For the 
purposes of providing representative estimates of the overall costs, a compound is 
produced by combining multiple pathways. This is done by combining assumptions 
for each of the different pathways, as was also undertaken in a study by UMAS 
(2018a). The guiding assumption is that supply will tend toward the most cost-
effective supply pathway. LNG demand is allocated with a ratio of 10 percent, 
80 percent, and 10 percent to the mix of the three pathways with the 80 percent 
dominant majority being the lowest-cost supply chain.
The LNG demand scenarios are calculated using the Global Transport Model 
(GloTraM)—a holistic model developed by the UCL Energy Institute—on a five-yearly 
basis. Yearly LNG demand is then linearly interpolated between these values. The 
necessary infrastructure capacity to support the next year’s demand is calculated 
such that a maximum of 70 percent of capacity is utilized. Assets are assumed to 
be decommissioned after 20 years, reducing available capacity. Interest, discount 
rates, and amortization are not considered in this assessment.
