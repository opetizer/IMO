IMO has adopted the following short-term measures Energy Efficiency Design Index EEDI, Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index EEXI, Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan SEEMP and Carbon Intensity Indicator CII. These measures mainly focus on vessels of 5000 GT and upwards and on international voyages."

      "text": "The key findings of the study are as follows as also partly presented in figure 1 below In the year 2018 the vessels in scope of the study emitted between 212 and 321 kt of CO2 all together. This is a rough estimation since exact numbers are not reported. More technical measures exist for the vessels in scope, because operational measures mainly have their biggest impact on relatively long trips. Technical measures that are applicable in the short term are typically characterized by smaller reduction potentials than measures that are more feasible on the longer term. Examples of these short-term measures are hull optimization, hybrid propulsion, wind-assisted propulsion and the use of LNG as fuel. Reductions between 3% and 30% can be reached. Technical measures that are applicable on the longer term include the use of alternative fuels hydrogen, ammonia etc. and full electric propulsion. Their reduction potential can range much further than the short-term technical measures up to 100% reduction possible. The reduction potential of smaller technical measures bow enhancement and waste heat recovery has a short payback time and can reach reductions between 2% and 8%. The operational measures can best be applied on cargo vessels. Reductions between 2% and 50% can be reached. Not all of the technical measures are applicable on all vessels in scope. The legal part of the study explained possibilities and restrictions for implementation on a national level."
